# System of polynomial equations

A system of polynomial equations is a collection of two or more polynomial equations that are related to each other. The equations are generally written in the form of a matrix, where each equation is represented by a row, and the variables are represented by the columns. A system of polynomial equations can be solved by finding the solutions to each equation separately and then combining them to find the overall solution. The solutions to a system of polynomial equations can be found using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, and factoring.
