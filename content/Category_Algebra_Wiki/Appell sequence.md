# Appell sequence

Appell sequence is a mathematical concept used to describe a sequence of numbers or objects. It is based on the idea of a sequence of numbers or objects that are arranged in a particular order. The Appell sequence is defined by a starting number, an ending number, and a set of rules for how each number or object should be arranged in order. 

For example, an Appell sequence can be defined as starting at 1 and ending at 10, with the rule that each number or object should be arranged in increasing order. This would result in a sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

The Appell sequence is a useful tool for understanding patterns and relationships between numbers or objects. It can also be used to create sequences of numbers or objects that follow a certain pattern.
