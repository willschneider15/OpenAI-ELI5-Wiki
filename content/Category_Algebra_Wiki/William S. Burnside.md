# William S. Burnside

William S. Burnside was a mathematician who developed the theory of finite groups. A finite group is a set of elements (or objects) that can be combined together in a certain way. The elements in a finite group must obey certain rules, known as the group's axioms. 

Burnside's theorem states that if a finite group has a certain property (called the "normalizer property"), then it must be either cyclic (all elements are equal) or it must contain an element of order two. This theorem is important because it provides a way to classify finite groups. 

Burnside's theorem is also used to prove theorems in algebra, number theory, and group theory. It is also used to prove the existence of certain types of finite groups. The theorem has been used to prove the existence of certain types of finite fields, and it has been used to prove the existence of certain types of finite groups.
