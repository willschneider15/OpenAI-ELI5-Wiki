# General Leibniz rule

General Leibniz rule is a rule that states that the derivative of a function is equal to the sum of the derivatives of each of its individual terms. It is named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German mathematician who developed it in the 17th century. 

The rule states that if a function can be expressed as a sum of several terms, then the derivative of the function is equal to the sum of the derivatives of each of the individual terms. For example, if a function is expressed as f(x)=x^2 + 2x + 1, then the derivative of the function is equal to 2x + 2. 

This rule is useful for finding the derivatives of functions that are composed of multiple terms. It simplifies the process of taking derivatives by allowing us to take the derivatives of each term separately and then adding them together. This makes it easier to find the derivatives of complex functions.
