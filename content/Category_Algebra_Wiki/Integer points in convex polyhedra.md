# Integer points in convex polyhedra

Integer points in convex polyhedra are points that are located on the vertices of a convex polyhedron, which is a 3-dimensional shape with faces that are all flat and connected. Integer points are points that have integer coordinates. This means that the coordinates of the point must be integers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc. Integer points in convex polyhedra are used to represent solutions to optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem. Integer points can also be used to represent the vertices of the polyhedron, which can then be used to determine the properties of the polyhedron. Integer points can help to solve problems quickly and efficiently, as they can be used to quickly identify the vertices of the polyhedron and the solutions to optimization problems.
