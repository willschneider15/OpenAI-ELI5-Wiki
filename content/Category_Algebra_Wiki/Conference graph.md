# Conference graph

A conference graph is a type of graph used to represent the relationships between different entities in a network. It is a type of directed graph, meaning that it has directed edges which represent the relationships between the entities. The nodes of a conference graph represent the entities, and the edges represent the relationships between them. The edges can have different weights, which represent the strength of the relationship between the entities. Conference graphs are used to visualize relationships between entities, and can be used to identify patterns, clusters, and outliers in a network. They are also used to identify communities and can help to identify influential nodes in a network.
