# Congruence relation

Congruence relation is a mathematical concept which describes the relationship between two objects that are the same size and shape. This concept is often used in geometry and it states that two objects are congruent if they are the same size and shape. Congruence relations can be represented by an equation, where two objects are said to be congruent if they satisfy the equation. For example, two triangles are congruent if they have the same three sides and the same three angles. Congruence relation is also used in other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, where two equations are said to be congruent if they have the same solution. Congruence relation is an important concept in mathematics, as it allows us to compare two objects and determine whether they are the same size and shape.
