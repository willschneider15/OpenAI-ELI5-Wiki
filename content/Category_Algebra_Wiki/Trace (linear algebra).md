# Trace (linear algebra)

Trace is a concept in linear algebra that is used to calculate the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix. The trace of a matrix is denoted by the symbol tr(A). A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The diagonal elements of a matrix are the numbers that are located on the main diagonal of the matrix, from the top left to the bottom right. The trace of a matrix is calculated by adding up all of the diagonal elements of the matrix. For example, if a matrix has 4 diagonal elements, the trace of the matrix would be the sum of all 4 diagonal elements. Trace is a useful tool in linear algebra because it can be used to help identify certain properties of a matrix, such as its determinant, rank, and eigenvalues.
