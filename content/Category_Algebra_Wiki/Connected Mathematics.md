# Connected Mathematics

Connected Mathematics is an approach to teaching math that focuses on making connections between mathematical concepts and real-world examples. It is designed to help students understand how math applies to their everyday lives and to help them learn problem-solving skills. The curriculum is divided into modules that cover topics such as measurement, geometry, data analysis, probability, and algebra. Each module includes activities that involve hands-on exploration, problem solving, and critical thinking. Connected Mathematics also encourages students to explore their own ideas and make connections between mathematical concepts and their own experiences. Through this approach, students can develop a deeper understanding of math and its applications.
