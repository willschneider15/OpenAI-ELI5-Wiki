# Productive matrix

The Productive Matrix is a concept used to measure the effectiveness of a company's operations. It is based on the idea that a company's operations can be divided into four distinct categories: efficiency, effectiveness, cost and quality. Each of these categories can then be further broken down into different metrics, such as time to market, customer satisfaction, cost per unit, and product quality. 

The Productive Matrix is used to measure the performance of a company across these four categories. This allows the company to identify areas of improvement, as well as areas of excellence. It also allows the company to compare its performance to that of other companies in the same industry. This helps the company identify potential areas of improvement, as well as areas where it is outperforming its competitors. 

The Productive Matrix is a valuable tool for companies looking to improve their operations and increase their profitability. By using the matrix, companies can identify areas of improvement and make changes that can lead to improved operations and increased profitability.
