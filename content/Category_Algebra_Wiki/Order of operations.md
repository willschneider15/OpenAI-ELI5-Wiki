# Order of operations

Order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the correct sequence in which to solve mathematical equations. It is also known as the PEMDAS rule, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. This rule ensures that equations are solved correctly and that the answer is accurate. 

For example, when solving the equation 2 + 5 x 6, the order of operations would tell us to first multiply 5 and 6, and then add 2 to the result. Without the order of operations, the equation could be solved in many different ways, and the answer would be different each time.

Order of operations is an important concept for children to understand as they begin to learn mathematics. It helps them to correctly solve equations and understand how to approach more complex equations. Knowing the order of operations can also help to prevent mistakes and ensure that the answer is accurate.
