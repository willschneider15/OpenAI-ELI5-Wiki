# Emmy Noether

Emmy Noether was a mathematician who lived in the early 1900s. She made important contributions to mathematics and physics, including discovering the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. She also discovered the law of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of a system remains the same unless an outside force is applied. In addition, she developed a new way of looking at symmetry in mathematical equations, which is now known as Noether's theorem. This theorem has become a fundamental part of modern physics and is used to explain how certain forces act in the universe. In short, Emmy Noether was a brilliant mathematician who made important discoveries that are still used today in physics and mathematics.
