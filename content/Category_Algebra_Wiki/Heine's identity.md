# Heine's identity

Heine's Identity is a mathematical concept that states that the sum of the squares of the roots of a given polynomial is equal to the coefficient of the polynomial's highest power multiplied by the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the polynomial's lower powers.

In simpler terms, Heine's Identity is a mathematical statement that says that if you have a polynomial equation, the sum of the squares of the roots of the equation will always be equal to the coefficient of the highest power of the equation multiplied by the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the lower powers. 

For example, if you have a polynomial equation with a highest power of 3, then the sum of the squares of the roots of the equation will always be equal to the coefficient of the 3rd power multiplied by the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the lower powers.
