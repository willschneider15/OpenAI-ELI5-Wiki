# Algebra tile

Algebra tiles are an interactive tool used to help students understand algebraic concepts. They are square pieces of cardboard with symbols on them that represent different algebraic concepts, such as numbers, variables, and operations. By manipulating the tiles, students can explore the relationships between algebraic concepts and solve equations. For example, students can use the tiles to model an equation such as 3x + 5 = 15. They can do this by arranging the tiles to represent the equation, with the 3x tile representing the variable, the 5 tile representing the constant, and the 15 tile representing the solution. By manipulating the tiles, students can see how changing the equation affects the solution. Algebra tiles are a great way for students to gain a better understanding of algebraic concepts and equations.
