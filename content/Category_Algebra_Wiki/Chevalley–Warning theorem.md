# Chevalley–Warning theorem

The Chevalley–Warning theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that if a polynomial equation has a solution in a field, then it has a solution in any field containing that field. In other words, if a polynomial equation can be solved in one field, then it can also be solved in any field that contains that field. In simple terms, if a math problem can be solved in one place, it can also be solved in any place that contains that place. This theorem is important because it helps mathematicians solve equations more quickly and efficiently.
