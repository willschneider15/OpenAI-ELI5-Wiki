# Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction

The Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is a mathematical concept that deals with the properties of certain infinite series of numbers. It was discovered by Srinivasa Ramanujan and Leonard James Rogers in the early 1900s.

The Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is a mathematical expression that is made up of a series of fractions that have been divided by one another. The fractions are of the form 1/(1+a1), 1/(1+a2), and so on. Each fraction is divided by the one before it, and the result is an infinite series of numbers.

The Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is important because it can be used to calculate the values of certain infinite series of numbers. These series of numbers can be used to calculate the values of mathematical functions, such as the gamma function.

The Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is an important concept in mathematics, and it has been used to solve various mathematical problems. It is a powerful tool for mathematicians and scientists, and it can be used to solve complex equations and problems.
