# Regular semi-algebraic system

Regular semi-algebraic systems are a type of mathematical system that is used to describe the behavior of certain types of functions. These systems are composed of polynomials, which are equations with multiple variables, and inequalities, which are statements that compare the values of two or more variables. Regular semi-algebraic systems are used to describe physical systems that can be modeled by polynomials, such as motion of particles or electrical circuits. These systems are characterized by the fact that the polynomials are all of the same degree, and the inequalities are all of the same type. Regular semi-algebraic systems can be used to solve problems such as finding the maximum or minimum of a function, or finding the roots of an equation. By using these systems, mathematicians are able to more accurately describe and predict the behavior of certain physical systems.
