# Primitive part and content

Primitive part and content is a concept that relates to the way in which humans perceive objects and experiences. Primitive parts refer to the basic elements of an object or experience that are perceived by humans. This can include the shape, size, color, texture, and other physical attributes. Content, on the other hand, refers to the meaning or significance of an object or experience. Content can be subjective and can include things like memories, emotions, and values associated with an object or experience. For example, a person might look at a photograph of a beach and perceive the primitive parts such as the sand, the waves, and the sky. However, the content of the photograph could be much more meaningful, such as a reminder of a happy childhood memory.
