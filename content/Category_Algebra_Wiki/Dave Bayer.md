# Dave Bayer

Dave Bayer is a mathematician who developed a way to explain math to kids. He created the idea of "Exploding Dots," which is a visual representation of math equations. Exploding Dots is a game where kids can use dots and other shapes to represent numbers and equations. They can then use these shapes to solve math problems and understand the concepts behind them. Dave Bayer's idea has been used in classrooms around the world, and it has helped kids understand math better and get better grades. It's a great way for kids to learn math in an interactive and fun way.
