# Embedding

Embedding is a way of representing data in a numerical format. It helps computers better understand the relationships between words and concepts. It does this by taking words or phrases and converting them into numerical vectors. These vectors are then used to represent the words in a mathematical space. This allows computers to compare and analyze the relationships between words and concepts. Embedding can be used for a variety of tasks such as natural language processing, text classification, and machine translation. It is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing data.
