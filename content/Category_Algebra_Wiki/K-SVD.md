# K-SVD

K-SVD stands for "K-Singular Value Decomposition". It is an algorithm used to represent a signal or image in terms of its most important features. It works by decomposing a signal or image into its basic components, known as "atoms", and then using these atoms to reconstruct the signal or image. The algorithm is useful for compressing data, as it allows for a smaller representation of the original signal or image. K-SVD is also used in machine learning tasks, such as image classification, as it can help to identify meaningful features in an image. In short, K-SVD is an algorithm that helps to represent a signal or image in terms of its most important features, and can be used for data compression and machine learning tasks.
