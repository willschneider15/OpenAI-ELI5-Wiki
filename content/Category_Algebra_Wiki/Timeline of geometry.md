# Timeline of geometry

Timeline of geometry is a way of understanding the history and development of geometry, from ancient times to the present day. It is helpful for students to understand how different mathematical concepts have evolved over time and how they are related. Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and angles, and is used in many areas of science, engineering, and art. The timeline of geometry includes the development of Euclidean geometry, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, and the development of modern geometry. It also includes the development of other mathematical concepts such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. By studying the timeline of geometry, students can gain insight into how geometry has evolved over time and how it is used today.
