# Row and column spaces

Row space is a set of all linear combinations of the row vectors of a matrix. It is a subspace of the vector space of all possible linear combinations of the matrix's columns. The row space is the set of all possible linear combinations of the row vectors of the matrix.

Column space is the set of all linear combinations of the column vectors of a matrix. It is a subspace of the vector space of all possible linear combinations of the matrix's rows. The column space is the set of all possible linear combinations of the column vectors of the matrix.

Row and column spaces are important in linear algebra because they provide insight into the structure of a matrix. By understanding the relationship between the row and column spaces, we can gain insight into the properties of the matrix, such as its rank, nullity, and determinant. Knowing the row and column spaces can also help us solve systems of linear equations.
