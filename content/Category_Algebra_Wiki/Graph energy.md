# Graph energy

Graph energy is a way of measuring how much energy is stored in a graph or network. It is based on the idea that the more connections a graph has, the more energy it holds. This energy can be used to power applications and algorithms that run on the graph. Graph energy is measured by counting the number of edges (connections) in the graph. The more edges a graph has, the higher its energy level. The energy level can also be affected by the type of nodes and edges in the graph. For example, if the graph has a lot of high-degree nodes (nodes that have many edges), then it will have more energy than a graph with fewer high-degree nodes. Graph energy is an important concept in graph theory and can be used to optimize algorithms and applications that run on graphs.
