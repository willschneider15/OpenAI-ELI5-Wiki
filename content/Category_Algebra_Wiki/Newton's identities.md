# Newton's identities

Newton's identities are a set of equations that can be used to calculate the sums of powers of the first n natural numbers. The equations are named after Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered them in 1676. 

The equations are as follows: 

* For n = 1, the equation is 1^1 = 1
* For n = 2, the equation is 1^2 + 2^2 = 3
* For n = 3, the equation is 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 14
* For n = 4, the equation is 1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 30

The equations can be extended to any n, and the pattern will continue to hold true. For example, for n = 5, the equation is 1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + 4^5 + 5^5 = 55.

Newton's identities can be used to solve a variety of mathematical problems, including calculating the sums of powers of the first n natural numbers, finding the sums of certain series, and more. They can also be used to prove many mathematical theorems.
