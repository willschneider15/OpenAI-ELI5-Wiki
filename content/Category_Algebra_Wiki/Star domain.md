# Star domain

Star domain is a type of network topology in which all nodes are connected to a single, central node. This central node is called the hub, and all other nodes are connected to it through cables or wireless connections. The hub acts as a central point of communication between all of the nodes, and each node is only connected to the hub, not to each other. This type of topology is useful in networks with a large number of nodes, as it simplifies the connections and allows for more efficient communication between the nodes. Additionally, star domain networks are very reliable, as if one node fails, the rest of the network will still be able to communicate.
