# Wolfgang Krull

Wolfgang Krull was a German mathematician who is best known for his work in algebraic number theory. His most famous contribution is the Krull dimension, which is a way of measuring the complexity of an algebraic structure. It is based on the number of prime ideals that are contained in the structure.

In simple terms, the Krull dimension is a way to measure the complexity of an algebraic structure. It is based on the number of prime ideals that are contained in the structure. The higher the number of prime ideals, the more complex the structure. This method of measuring complexity has been used in many areas of mathematics and is still widely used today.
