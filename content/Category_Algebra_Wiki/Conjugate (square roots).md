# Conjugate (square roots)

Conjugate square roots are a concept used in mathematics to simplify equations. It is based on the idea that two square roots can be combined to form a single square root. For example, if the square root of x is equal to the square root of y, then the two square roots can be combined to form the square root of x + y. This is known as a conjugate square root. 

The concept of conjugate square roots can be used to simplify equations by reducing the number of square roots that need to be evaluated. For example, if the equation is x + y = z, then the equation can be simplified to the square root of x + the square root of y = the square root of z. This eliminates the need to evaluate the individual square roots of x and y, which can be time consuming. 

Conjugate square roots can also be used to solve equations that involve square roots. For example, if the equation is x + y = z2, then the equation can be solved by taking the square root of both sides, which yields the equation the square root of x + the square root of y = z. This allows the equation to be solved by simply substit
