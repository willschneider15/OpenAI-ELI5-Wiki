# Fredholm alternative

The Fredholm Alternative is a theorem in mathematics that states that a linear equation can either have no solutions or an infinite number of solutions. It is named after the Swedish mathematician Erik Ivar Fredholm, who first published the theorem in 1903.

The theorem states that a linear equation of the form Ax = b can either have no solutions (called an inconsistent system) or an infinite number of solutions (called a consistent system). In the case of an inconsistent system, the equation cannot be solved. In the case of a consistent system, the equation can be solved by finding a particular solution, and then adding any linear combination of the solutions of the homogeneous equation Ax = 0.

In conclusion, the Fredholm Alternative is a theorem that states that a linear equation can either have no solutions or an infinite number of solutions. Understanding the theorem is important for solving linear equations.
