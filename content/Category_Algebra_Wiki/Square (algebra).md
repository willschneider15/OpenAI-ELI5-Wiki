# Square (algebra)

Square in algebra is a way of multiplying a number by itself. It is written as x<sup>2</sup>, which means that x is multiplied by itself. For example, if x=2, then x<sup>2</sup>=2x2=4. In other words, when you square a number, you are multiplying it by itself. 

Squaring a number is also known as "raising it to the second power". When you square a number, you are making it bigger. For example, if you square the number 2, you get 4 because 2x2=4. You can also square a negative number, such as -2. In this case, you would get 4, because (-2)x(-2)=4. 

In summary, squaring a number is a way of multiplying it by itself. It is written as x<sup>2</sup>, and it makes the number bigger. You can also square a negative number, and the result will still be positive.
