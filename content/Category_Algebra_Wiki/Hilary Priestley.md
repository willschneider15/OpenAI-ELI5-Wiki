# Hilary Priestley

Hilary Priestley was a British educational philosopher who believed that education should focus on the individual student and their own unique needs and interests. She believed that a student's individual potential should be the primary focus of their education, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Priestley argued that a student's education should be tailored to their individual goals and capabilities, and that teachers should be flexible in their approach to teaching and learning. She also argued that the aim of education should be to foster independent thinking and creativity in students, rather than simply teaching them to memorize facts and figures. Priestley's philosophy has been influential in shaping modern educational practices, and her ideas are still relevant today.
