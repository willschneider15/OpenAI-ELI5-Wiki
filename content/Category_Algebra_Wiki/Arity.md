# Arity

Arity is a way of describing the number of arguments (inputs) a function or operation can take. For example, a function that takes two arguments can be said to have an arity of two. Arity is important because it helps us understand how a function works. For example, if we know a function has an arity of two, we can assume it needs two arguments in order to work properly. If we try to give it only one argument, it will not work correctly. Arity is a way of understanding how functions and operations work, and it can be a helpful tool when programming.
