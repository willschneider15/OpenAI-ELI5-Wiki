# Eigengap

Eigengap is a concept used in mathematics and computer science. It is the difference between the largest and second largest eigenvalues (values associated with a linear transformation) of a matrix. The larger the eigengap, the more well-defined the structure of the matrix is.

For example, if a matrix has a large eigengap, it means that the largest eigenvalue is much larger than the second largest eigenvalue. This indicates that the matrix is well-structured and has a clear pattern. On the other hand, if the eigengap is small, it means that the largest and second largest eigenvalues are close in value, indicating that the matrix is not as well-structured and may have a more random pattern.
