# Moshe Meiselman

Moshe Meiselman is a popular Jewish philosopher who wrote about the concept of "bittul hayesh", or self-nullification. This concept is based on the idea that one should strive to be humble and recognize that one's own individual desires and opinions are not important compared to the will of God. In order to practice this concept, one should strive to be aware of the fact that God is in control and that one should not be attached to their own individual desires and opinions. This concept is important to many Jewish people because it helps them to stay focused on the will of God and not be distracted by their own individual desires. By practicing this concept, one can become closer to God and be more in tune with His will.
