# Ernst Witt

Ernst Witt was a German philosopher who wrote about the concept of "living in the moment." This means that instead of worrying about the past or worrying about the future, we should focus on the present and make the most of it. He believed that by living in the present, we can be more mindful and take the time to appreciate the little things in life. This can help us to be more content and less anxious. He also believed that by living in the moment we can be more aware of our own thoughts and feelings, and find ways to improve our lives.
