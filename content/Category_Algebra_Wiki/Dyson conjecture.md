# Dyson conjecture

Dyson Conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1962. It states that any polynomial equation with integer coefficients that has a finite number of solutions must have an infinite number of solutions when the coefficients are allowed to vary over the rational numbers. In other words, the conjecture states that any polynomial equation with integer coefficients can be solved by a polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

In simple terms, the Dyson Conjecture suggests that if you have an equation with a finite number of solutions when all of the numbers are integers, then you will have an infinite number of solutions when the numbers can be any rational number. This is an important concept in mathematics because it could help us find solutions to problems that we can't solve with just integers.
