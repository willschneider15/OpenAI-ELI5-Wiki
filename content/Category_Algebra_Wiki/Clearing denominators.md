# Clearing denominators

Clearing denominators is a mathematical concept used to simplify fractions. It involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number, so that the denominator becomes equal to 1. This is done by finding the least common multiple of the denominator and the number being multiplied. 

For example, if the fraction is $\frac{5}{6}$, the least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30. Therefore, to clear the denominator, you would multiply the numerator and denominator by 30. The simplified fraction would then be $\frac{150}{30}$, which is equal to $\frac{5}{1}$. 

Clearing denominators is a useful tool for simplifying fractions and making them easier to work with. It can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions, as well as to solve equations.
