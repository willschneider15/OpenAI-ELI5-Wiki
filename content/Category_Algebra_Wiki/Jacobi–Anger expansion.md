# Jacobi–Anger expansion

The Jacobi–Anger expansion is a mathematical formula used to calculate the value of a complex number. It is named after the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi and the French mathematician Jean-Robert Anger. 

The formula is written as follows:

z = x + iy = r(cosθ + i sinθ) = r ∑n=0 ∞ ((-1)^n (sinθ)^(2n+1))/(2n+1)!

In this equation, z is the complex number, x and y are the real and imaginary components of z, r is the magnitude of z, θ is the angle of z, and i is the imaginary unit. 

In simpler terms, the Jacobi–Anger expansion is used to convert a complex number into its real and imaginary components. It is a very useful tool in mathematics and physics.
