# Matrix sign function

The Matrix sign function is a mathematical operation that takes two matrices and returns a third matrix. It is used to calculate the sign of a matrix, which is a numerical value that represents the sign of the entries in the matrix. The sign of a matrix is determined by comparing the values of each element in the matrix with zero. If the value is greater than zero, the sign is positive; if it is less than zero, the sign is negative; and if it is equal to zero, the sign is zero. The Matrix sign function is useful for analyzing the structure of a matrix and for performing operations on matrices. It can also be used to determine the rank of a matrix, which is the number of non-zero elements in the matrix.
