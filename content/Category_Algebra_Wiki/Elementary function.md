# Elementary function

Elementary functions are a type of mathematical function that can be defined with a single expression. They are used to express relationships between two or more variables and can be used to model real-world situations. Examples of elementary functions include polynomials, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions. 

These functions are important because they can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, polynomials can be used to find the area of a triangle, exponential functions can be used to model population growth, and logarithmic functions can be used to calculate the value of a stock over time. 

Elementary functions can also be used to find the roots of equations, which is the solution to the equation. By using basic algebra, the roots of an equation can be found by solving for the values of the variables that make the equation equal to zero. 

In conclusion, elementary functions are important mathematical functions that can be used to solve a variety of problems. They can be used to model real-world situations, find the roots of equations, and calculate the value of a stock over time.
