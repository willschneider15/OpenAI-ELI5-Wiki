# Seidel adjacency matrix

Seidel adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph in a mathematical form. It is a square matrix that contains a 1 or 0 in each cell. A 1 represents an edge between two vertices in the graph, while a 0 represents no edge. It is named after the mathematician Jakob Seidel, who first proposed this concept in 1883. Seidel adjacency matrices can be used to solve problems in graph theory, such as finding the shortest path between two vertices, or determining if a graph is connected.
