# Regularized least squares

Regularized least squares is a method of fitting a linear model to data that helps reduce the risk of overfitting. It works by adding a penalty to the loss function, which makes the model more robust and less sensitive to outliers. The penalty is a function of the complexity of the model, which means that more complex models will be penalized more heavily. This encourages the model to find a simpler solution that generalizes better. Regularized least squares can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions and reduce the risk of overfitting.
