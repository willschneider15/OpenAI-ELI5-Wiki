# Eigenvalue perturbation

Eigenvalue perturbation is a mathematical concept used to analyze the effects of small changes in a system. It is based on the idea that small changes in a system can have a big impact on the output of the system. The concept of eigenvalue perturbation is used to determine the sensitivity of the system to small changes in its parameters. It is also used to identify the most influential parameters in the system. It is a useful tool for engineers and scientists to understand how their systems may be affected by small changes.
