# Hahn–Banach theorem

The Hahn–Banach theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that if a linear functional (a function that takes a vector and assigns a number to it) is defined on a vector space, then it can be extended to a larger vector space. In other words, the theorem states that if a function is defined on one space, it can be extended to a bigger space. This theorem is used in many areas of mathematics, including functional analysis and optimization. 

In simpler terms, the Hahn–Banach theorem states that if you have a function defined on one space, you can make it bigger by extending it to a bigger space. This can be thought of as taking a small circle and making it bigger by adding more points around it.
