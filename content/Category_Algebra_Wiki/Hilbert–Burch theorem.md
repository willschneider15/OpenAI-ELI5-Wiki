# Hilbert–Burch theorem

Hilbert–Burch theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that every finitely generated ideal in a polynomial ring can be generated by a regular sequence of length equal to the number of generators. In other words, it tells us that any ideal in a polynomial ring can be generated by a certain number of polynomials. 

In simpler terms, the Hilbert–Burch theorem is a way to find a set of polynomials that can be used to describe any ideal in a polynomial ring. This can be useful in solving equations and understanding the behavior of polynomials.
