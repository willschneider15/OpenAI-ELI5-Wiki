# List of mathematical identities

A mathematical identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variables. A list of mathematical identities is a collection of equations that are true for all values of the variables. This list can include identities for trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, exponential functions, and other mathematical equations. These identities can be used to simplify equations, solve equations, and prove mathematical theorems. They can also be used to prove theorems in calculus and other areas of mathematics. The list of mathematical identities is an invaluable tool for mathematicians and students of mathematics.
