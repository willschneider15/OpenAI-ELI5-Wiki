# Polynomial long division

Polynomial long division is a way to divide two polynomials. It involves dividing the highest degree term of the first polynomial (the dividend) by the highest degree term of the second polynomial (the divisor). The answer to this division is called the quotient. 

The quotient is then multiplied by the divisor and subtracted from the dividend. This leaves a remainder which is the polynomial that is left over after the division. This process is then repeated with the remainder and the divisor until the remainder is a polynomial of degree lower than the divisor. 

The quotient is the answer to the division and the remainder is the leftover polynomial. This process can be used to divide any two polynomials.
