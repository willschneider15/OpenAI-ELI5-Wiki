# Siegel identity

Siegel identity is a mathematical concept that states that a certain type of equation can be solved in a certain way. It is named after Carl Ludwig Siegel, a German mathematician who discovered it in 1929. 

The equation that Siegel identity applies to is an equation that has two variables, x and y, and an unknown constant, c. The equation is: 

$$x^2 + y^2 = c$$

The Siegel identity states that the solution to this equation is: 

$$x = \sqrt{c/2} \cos \theta$$
$$y = \sqrt{c/2} \sin \theta$$

where $\theta$ is an angle between 0 and 2$\pi$. This means that for any given value of c, there is an infinite number of solutions for x and y.
