# Basis (linear algebra)

Basis is a concept in linear algebra that refers to a set of vectors that can be used to represent any vector in a given vector space. A basis is made up of linearly independent vectors, which means that none of the vectors in the basis can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the basis. A basis is also a spanning set, which means that any vector in the vector space can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis. In other words, the basis vectors span the entire vector space.
