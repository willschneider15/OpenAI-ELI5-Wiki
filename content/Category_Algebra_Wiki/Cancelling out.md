# Cancelling out

Cancelling out is a way of solving math equations. It is a way of simplifying equations by removing terms that appear on both sides of the equation. 

For example, if you have the equation 5 + 3 = 8, you can cancel out the 3 on both sides of the equation. This leaves you with 5 = 8. 

To cancel out, you need to do the same thing to both sides of the equation. If you have the equation 5 + 3 = 8, you can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. This leaves you with 5 = 8. 

Cancelling out is a useful tool for solving equations quickly and easily. It is a way of simplifying equations and getting rid of terms that appear on both sides of the equation.
