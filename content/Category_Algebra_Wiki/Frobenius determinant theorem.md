# Frobenius determinant theorem

Frobenius determinant theorem states that if a matrix has only one row or one column of all zeros, then the determinant of that matrix is zero. This theorem is useful when solving systems of linear equations. It can help us determine when the system has no solution, or when the system has an infinite number of solutions. The theorem works by recognizing that if a matrix has a row or column of all zeros, then the determinant of the matrix must be zero. This means that the system of equations must be inconsistent, and thus has no solution.
