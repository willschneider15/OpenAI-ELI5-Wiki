# Graded-commutative ring

A graded-commutative ring is a type of mathematical structure that combines two properties: grading and commutativity. Grading means that the ring is divided into different levels, like a hierarchy. Each level is associated with a number, called the degree. Commutativity means that the order of the elements in a multiplication equation doesn't matter. For example, if you multiply two numbers together, it doesn't matter which one comes first. 

In a graded-commutative ring, the multiplication of two elements is only allowed if their degrees are the same. This means that elements in higher levels can only be multiplied with elements in the same level. This property makes graded-commutative rings useful in many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.
