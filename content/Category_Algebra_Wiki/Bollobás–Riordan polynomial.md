# Bollobás–Riordan polynomial

The Bollobás–Riordan polynomial is a mathematical tool used to study the structure of graphs. It is a polynomial that encodes information about a graph's edges, vertices, and cycles. It is named after mathematicians Paul Erdős and Paul Bollobás, who first developed the concept.

The polynomial is calculated by assigning a variable to each edge in the graph, and then multiplying the variables together. The coefficient of each term in the polynomial encodes information about the graph, such as the number of edges, vertices, and cycles. This information can be used to study the structure of the graph, as well as its properties.

The Bollobás–Riordan polynomial is a powerful tool for studying graphs and can be used to solve many problems in graph theory. It is a useful tool for understanding the structure of graphs and can be used to answer questions about how graphs are connected.
