# Jordan–Pólya number

The Jordan–Pólya number is a mathematical concept that measures how many different ways a problem can be solved. It takes into account the number of steps needed to solve a problem, the number of different solutions that are possible, and the number of different ways those solutions can be combined. This number is useful for determining the complexity of a problem, and can help to identify the best approach for solving it. The Jordan–Pólya number can also be used to compare the difficulty of different problems.
