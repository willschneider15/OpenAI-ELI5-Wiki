# Edge-transitive graph

Edge-transitive graphs are graphs in which, for every pair of edges, there is a symmetry that allows you to swap them. This means that, if you take any two edges in the graph, there is some kind of operation that can be performed to swap them. This operation could be a rotation, a reflection, or a combination of the two. Edge-transitive graphs are important in graph theory, as they provide insight into the structure of graphs and how they can be manipulated.
