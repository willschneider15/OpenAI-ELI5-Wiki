# Robert Guralnick

Robert Guralnick is a scientist who studies evolution. He believes that evolution is a process of change over time and that it is driven by natural selection, or the idea that some traits are more advantageous than others in certain environments. He believes that this process leads to the emergence of new species and that it can be studied through the fossil record. He has also studied the genetic diversity of species and how it can be used to understand the history of life on Earth. Guralnick's research has helped to shape our understanding of how evolution works and how species have adapted to their environments.
