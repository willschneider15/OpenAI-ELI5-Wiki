# Cokernel

Cokernel is a concept in mathematics that describes the relationship between two sets of objects. It is a way of looking at how two sets of objects interact with each other.

The cokernel of two sets is the set of all objects that are not related to each other. For example, if we have two sets of numbers, the cokernel is the set of all numbers that are not related to each other. This means that the cokernel is the set of objects that are not related in any way.

Cokernel is an important concept in mathematics because it helps us understand relationships between different sets of objects. It also helps us identify patterns in data and make better predictions about the future. Cokernel is a useful tool for mathematicians, scientists, and other professionals who need to analyze data and make predictions.
