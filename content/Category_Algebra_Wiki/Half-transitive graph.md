# Half-transitive graph

A half-transitive graph is a type of directed graph where all vertices are connected to each other, but not all edges are transitive. This means that while there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex, there may be some edges that do not follow a transitive relationship. For example, if vertex A is connected to vertex B and vertex B is connected to vertex C, then a transitive relationship would mean that vertex A is also connected to vertex C. In a half-transitive graph, this may not always be the case.
