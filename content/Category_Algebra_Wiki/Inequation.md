# Inequation

Inequations are mathematical statements that compare two expressions using an inequality sign. These signs can be greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols, or the symbols for greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to (≤). Inequations are used to determine if the expressions are true or false.

For example, if we were to compare two numbers, 5 and 10, we could use an inequation to determine if 5 is less than 10. We would write the statement as 5 < 10. This statement is true, and so the inequation is true.

Inequations can also be used to determine if two expressions are equal. For example, if we wanted to determine if 5 is equal to 10, we could write the statement as 5 = 10. This statement is false, and so the inequation is false.

Inequations can also be used to solve for a variable. For example, if we wanted to find the value of x that makes the statement 5 + x = 10 true, we could write the statement as 5 + x = 10. We can then solve the inequation to find the value of x, which is 5
