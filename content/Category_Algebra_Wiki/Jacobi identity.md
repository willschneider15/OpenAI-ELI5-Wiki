# Jacobi identity

Jacobi identity is a mathematical identity that relates three vectors in three dimensional space. It states that the dot product of any two of the vectors multiplied together is equal to the dot product of the third vector with the cross product of the other two vectors. In other words, if A, B, and C are three vectors, then: 

A · (B × C) = (A × B) · C

This identity is very useful for solving problems in physics, engineering, and other fields. It can be used to simplify equations and help find solutions to complex problems.
