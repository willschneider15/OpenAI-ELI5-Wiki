# E∞-operad

An E∞-operad is a type of mathematical structure that is used to describe symmetries in algebraic equations. It is like a set of instructions that tells us how to combine different parts of an equation to make a new equation. The E∞ part of the name stands for "endomorphism", which means that the instructions can be used over and over again to create different equations. To put it simply, an E∞-operad is like a set of rules that helps us create new equations from old ones.
