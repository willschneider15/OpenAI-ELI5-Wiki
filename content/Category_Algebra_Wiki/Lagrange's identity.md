# Lagrange's identity

Lagrange's identity is a mathematical equation that states the sum of the squares of three numbers is equal to the square of the sum of those three numbers. It looks like this:

`a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)²`

In other words, if you add up the squares of three numbers, then add up the three numbers and square that sum, it will be the same as the sum of the squares. For example, if you have the numbers 1, 2, and 3, the sum of the squares would be 1² + 2² + 3² = 14, and the square of the sum would be (1 + 2 + 3)² = 36. 14 and 36 are the same!

Lagrange's identity is a fun way to show how math works, and it's also a useful tool for solving equations.
