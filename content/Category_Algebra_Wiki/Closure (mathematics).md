# Closure (mathematics)

Closures are a concept in mathematics that can be thought of as a way of keeping track of the boundaries of a set. A closure is the set of all points that are included in a set and all points that can be reached from those points by following a certain rule. For example, the closure of a set of numbers could be the set of all numbers that are greater than or equal to the numbers in the original set. Closures are important because they help us understand the relationships between different sets and can be used to solve problems.
