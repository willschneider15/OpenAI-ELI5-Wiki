# Dual norm

Dual Norm is a mathematical concept that helps to measure the distance between two points. It is used in linear algebra, optimization, and other fields. The dual norm of a vector is the maximum of its absolute values. The dual norm of a matrix is the maximum of the absolute values of its elements. The dual norm is useful in many applications, such as finding the shortest path between two points. It can also be used to measure the quality of an optimization solution. The dual norm is also known as the infinity norm or the maximum norm.
