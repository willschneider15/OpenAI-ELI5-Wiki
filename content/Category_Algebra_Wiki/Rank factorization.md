# Rank factorization

Rank factorization is a mathematical technique used to decompose a matrix into its constituent parts. It is used to analyze the structure of a matrix and to identify patterns, correlations, and trends. In rank factorization, the matrix is decomposed into a product of two matrices, one of which is a square matrix with the same rank as the original matrix, and the other is a rectangular matrix with the same number of columns as the original matrix. The rank of the matrix is determined by the number of independent columns or rows, which is the number of non-zero entries in the matrix. The rank factorization technique can be used to identify patterns in data, to identify correlations between different variables, and to identify trends in data.
