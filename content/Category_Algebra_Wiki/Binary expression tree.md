# Binary expression tree

A binary expression tree is a data structure used to represent a mathematical expression. It is composed of nodes, with each node containing a value and two children, representing the left and right subtrees. The leaves of the tree are the operands, and the internal nodes represent the operators. The root of the tree is the operator at the highest precedence.

Binary expression trees are useful in evaluating mathematical expressions. The order of evaluation is determined by the tree structure, with the left subtree evaluated before the right subtree. The result of the expression is obtained by traversing the tree in a postorder fashion. This allows for efficient evaluation of complex expressions, as the expression is only evaluated once.
