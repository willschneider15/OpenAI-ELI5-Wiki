# Norm residue isomorphism theorem

The Norm Residue Isomorphism Theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that the multiplicative group of a finite field is isomorphic to the group of the residues modulo a prime number. This theorem has important implications for number theory, cryptography, and coding theory. In essence, it means that the group of residues modulo a prime number can be used to represent the group of elements in a finite field, which can be used to solve certain mathematical problems. This is done by first finding the prime number that is the modulus of the field, and then using the group of residues to represent the multiplicative group of the field. The isomorphism theorem is then used to map the elements of the field to the residues, allowing for the solution of certain mathematical problems.
