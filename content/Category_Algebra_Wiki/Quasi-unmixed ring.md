# Quasi-unmixed ring

A Quasi-unmixed ring is a type of mathematical structure that is used to describe relationships between algebraic objects. It is a generalization of a ring, which is a set of elements with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties. The Quasi-unmixed ring is an extension of the ring concept, allowing for the addition of a third operation, called "quasi-multiplication". This operation is similar to multiplication, but has different properties. Quasi-unmixed rings are useful in algebraic geometry, where they can be used to describe the structure of a variety, or a set of equations. They are also used in algebraic number theory and algebraic topology.
