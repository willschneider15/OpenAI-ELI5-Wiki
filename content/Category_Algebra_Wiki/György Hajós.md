# György Hajós

György Hajós was a Hungarian engineer and architect who developed the concept of "Hajós Algorithm". This algorithm is a mathematical method used to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces. It is an efficient way to solve problems and is used in many different fields, such as computer science, engineering, economics, and finance.

The algorithm works by breaking down a problem into smaller components and then finding solutions for each component. It then combines the solutions of each component to find a solution for the whole problem. This method is often used to solve complex problems that require multiple steps.

György Hajós was a pioneer in the field of mathematics and his algorithm is still used today. It is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is used in many different fields.
