# Dimension

Dimension is a concept that is used to describe the size and shape of objects. It is usually expressed as a number of length, width, and height. For example, a cube has three dimensions: length, width, and height.

Dimension is also used to measure the size of something. For example, if you were to measure the size of a room, you would need to measure its length, width, and height. These measurements would be the dimensions of the room.

Dimension is also used to describe the shape of something. For example, a circle has one dimension, a square has two dimensions, and a cube has three dimensions.

Dimension is an important concept to understand when it comes to mathematics, engineering, and other sciences. It allows us to measure and describe the size and shape of objects.
