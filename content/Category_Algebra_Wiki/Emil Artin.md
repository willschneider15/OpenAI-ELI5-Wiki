# Emil Artin

Emil Artin was a mathematician who worked in the early 1900s. He is best known for his contributions to algebra, which is a branch of mathematics that studies equations and numbers. Artin's work focused on abstract algebra, which is a type of mathematics that looks at the structure of equations and numbers, rather than the actual numbers themselves. Artin's main contribution to algebra was the development of the Artin-Wedderburn theorem, which states that any algebraic structure can be broken down into a series of smaller pieces. This theorem has been used in many areas of mathematics, including number theory, group theory, and topology. Artin's work has also had a major influence on modern algebra, helping to shape the way we think about and use algebra today.
