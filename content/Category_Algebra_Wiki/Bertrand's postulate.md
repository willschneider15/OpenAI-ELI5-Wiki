# Bertrand's postulate

Bertrand's Postulate states that for any given number, there is always at least one prime number between it and the next higher number. This means that if you pick any number, you can always find a prime number between it and the next higher number. For example, if you pick the number 10, the prime numbers between 10 and 11 are 10 and 11. This postulate was first proposed by Joseph Louis Fran√ßois Bertrand in 1845. It is an important concept in mathematics and is used in number theory and cryptography. It is also used to prove the Prime Number Theorem.
