# Skew-Hermitian matrix

A Skew-Hermitian matrix is a type of matrix that has complex entries and is related to Hermitian matrices. A Hermitian matrix is a type of matrix where the elements on the diagonal are real numbers, and the elements that are not on the diagonal are the complex conjugates of each other. A Skew-Hermitian matrix is a matrix where the elements on the diagonal are all 0, and the elements that are not on the diagonal are the negative of the complex conjugates of each other. Skew-Hermitian matrices are useful in quantum mechanics and other areas of mathematics.
