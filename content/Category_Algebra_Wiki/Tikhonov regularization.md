# Tikhonov regularization

Tikhonov regularization is a way of reducing the complexity of a problem by adding a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term is meant to limit the size of the coefficients in the model and prevent overfitting. By doing this, the model can better generalize to unseen data and make more accurate predictions. In short, Tikhonov regularization helps to reduce the complexity of a model and prevent overfitting.
