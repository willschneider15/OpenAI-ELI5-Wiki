# Perron's irreducibility criterion

Perron's irreducibility criterion is a tool used to determine if a polynomial is irreducible (cannot be broken down into simpler polynomials). It states that if the leading coefficient of a polynomial is positive and the absolute value of the coefficient of the highest degree term is greater than the sum of the absolute values of all other coefficients, then the polynomial is irreducible.

In simpler terms, Perron's irreducibility criterion is a way to tell if a polynomial can be broken down into simpler polynomials. To do this, you look at the numbers (coefficients) in the polynomial. If the number at the very beginning (leading coefficient) is positive and the number at the very end (highest degree term) is larger than the sum of all the other numbers, then the polynomial is not able to be broken down.
