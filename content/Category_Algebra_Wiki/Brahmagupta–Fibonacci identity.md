# Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity

The Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity is a mathematical equation that states that the product of two sums of two squares is equal to the sum of two other squares. In other words, the equation states that if you multiply two numbers that are the sum of two squares, you will get another number that is the sum of two squares. 

For example, if you have two numbers that are the sum of two squares, like 4 and 9, then the equation states that if you multiply those two numbers together (4 x 9 = 36), then the result (36) is also the sum of two squares (6 and 6). 

In mathematical terms, the equation looks like this: (a^2 + b^2) x (c^2 + d^2) = (a x c)^2 + (b x d)^2 + (a x d)^2 + (b x c)^2. 

In short, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity states that if you multiply two numbers that are the sum of two squares, you will get another number that is also the sum of two squares.
