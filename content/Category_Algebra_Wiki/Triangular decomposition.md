# Triangular decomposition

Triangular decomposition is a method of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. It works by first identifying the problem, then breaking it down into three parts: the input, the process, and the output. The input is the data that is given to the system. The process is the set of instructions that will be used to solve the problem. The output is the result of the process.

Triangular decomposition is an effective way to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. By breaking down the problem into smaller parts, it is easier to identify the underlying issues and to create a solution. This helps to reduce time and resources spent on solving the problem.
