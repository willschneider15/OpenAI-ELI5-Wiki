# Sherman–Morrison formula

The Sherman–Morrison formula is a mathematical formula that allows for the quick calculation of the inverse of a matrix with a rank-one modification. It is named after James M. Sherman and W. J. Morrison, who discovered it in 1950.

The formula is useful in solving linear equations and in calculating determinants. It states that if A is an n × n matrix and u and v are two n-dimensional vectors, then the inverse of A + uv<sup>T</sup> can be calculated as (A<sup>-1</sup> - (A<sup>-1</sup>uv<sup>T</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>) / (1 + v<sup>T</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>u).

The Sherman–Morrison formula is particularly useful because it can be applied to matrices of any size and can be used to quickly calculate the inverse of a matrix with a rank-one modification. This makes it a valuable tool for solving linear equations and calculating determinants.
