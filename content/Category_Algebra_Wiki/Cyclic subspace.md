# Cyclic subspace

A cyclic subspace is a type of vector space that is generated by a single vector. This vector is called the generator vector and all the other vectors in the space are created by applying linear transformations to the generator vector. This means that when you apply a linear transformation to a vector in the cyclic subspace, the result will be another vector in the same space. This is why it is called cyclic - the transformation will always bring you back to the same space.
