# Closure with a twist

Closure is a concept that can help children understand that things can end and then start again. It can be used to help kids cope with change, transitions, and endings. Closure can help children understand that endings are not necessarily bad, but can provide a chance to start something new. 

A fun way to explain closure to a five-year-old is to use an analogy. For example, you can explain that closure is like a game of hide-and-seek. When the game is over, it's time to find a new game to play. In the same way, when something ends, it's time to find something new to do. Closure helps kids understand that endings can be a chance to start something new and exciting.
