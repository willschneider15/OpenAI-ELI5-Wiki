# Transpose

Transpose is a way of rearranging data in a table or spreadsheet. It changes the rows and columns of the data so that the data is in a different order. For example, if you had a table of data with the names of people in the first column and their ages in the second column, transposing the table would make the ages the first column and the names the second column. Transposing makes it easier to organize and view data in different ways.
