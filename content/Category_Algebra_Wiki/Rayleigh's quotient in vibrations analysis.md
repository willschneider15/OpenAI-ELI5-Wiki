# Rayleigh's quotient in vibrations analysis

Rayleigh's Quotient is a mathematical tool used in vibration analysis. It is a ratio of two values that helps to determine the natural frequency of a vibrating system. The two values are the kinetic energy of the system and the potential energy of the system. The ratio is calculated by dividing the kinetic energy by the potential energy. If the Rayleigh's Quotient is equal to one, then the system is at its natural frequency. If the Rayleigh's Quotient is greater than one, then the system is vibrating at a higher frequency than its natural frequency. If the Rayleigh's Quotient is less than one, then the system is vibrating at a lower frequency than its natural frequency. Rayleigh's Quotient is a useful tool for vibration analysis, as it can help to identify the natural frequency of a system and determine if the system is vibrating at its natural frequency.
