# Z-order curve

A Z-Order Curve is a way of visualizing data that is organized in a grid. It is a type of space-filling curve, meaning that it covers a two-dimensional area without any gaps or overlaps. It is also known as a Morton Order, or Morton Code. 

The Z-Order Curve works by assigning each point in the grid a unique number, which is then used to order the points. Points that are close together in the grid will have similar numbers, while points that are further apart will have different numbers. This allows the points to be sorted in a logical order, which makes it easier to visualize the data. 

The Z-Order Curve is often used in data visualization and computer graphics, as it can help to make complex data easier to understand. It can also be used in databases to quickly retrieve data from large datasets.
