# Lagrange's identity (boundary value problem)

Lagrange's identity is a mathematical equation used to solve boundary value problems. It is used to find the solution to a differential equation when the boundary conditions of a given problem are known. In simple terms, it is used to determine the values of a function at the boundaries of a given region. The equation is written as: 

$$\int_{a}^{b} (f(x) + f''(x))dx = f(b) - f(a)$$ 

where a and b are the boundaries of the region, and f(x) is a function defined on the region. The left side of the equation is the sum of the function and its second derivative, while the right side is the difference between the values of the function at the two boundaries. By solving the equation, we can determine the values of the function at the boundaries.
