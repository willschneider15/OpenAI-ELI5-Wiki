# Nullspace property

Nullspace is a mathematical concept that describes a set of vectors that are all zero when multiplied by a matrix. This means that when a matrix is multiplied by a vector in the nullspace, the result is always a vector of zeros. This property is useful in linear algebra because it can help identify when two matrices are similar, and it can also help solve certain types of equations. For example, if you have a system of equations and you want to find the solution, you can use the nullspace property to figure out which vectors make the equation true.
