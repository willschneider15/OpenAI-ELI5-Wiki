# Pairing

Pairing is a way for two people to work together to solve a problem. It is often used in computer programming, where two people work together to create a program or solve a problem.

The idea is that two people can come up with better ideas and solutions than one person working alone. When two people work together, they can discuss ideas, ask questions, and help each other out.

Pairing also helps to speed up the process of solving a problem. Two people can divide up the work and work on different parts of the problem at the same time. This can make the process go much faster than if one person was working alone.

Pairing also helps to create a better understanding of the problem. Two people can discuss the problem and come up with a better understanding of what the problem is and how to solve it.

Overall, pairing is a great way to work together and solve a problem. It helps two people come up with better ideas, speed up the process of solving the problem, and create a better understanding of the problem.
