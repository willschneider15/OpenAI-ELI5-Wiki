# Douglas Northcott

Douglas Northcott was an economist who developed the concept of transaction costs. Transaction costs are the costs associated with making an economic transaction, such as buying and selling goods or services. Transaction costs include things like taxes, fees, and other costs associated with the process of making a transaction. Northcott argued that transaction costs are an important factor to consider when making economic decisions, as they can have a large impact on the overall cost of a transaction. For example, if taxes are high, it may be more expensive to buy a certain item than to purchase it elsewhere. Transaction costs can also be beneficial, as they can help to reduce the cost of certain transactions, such as when a business is able to negotiate a lower price due to lower taxes or fees.
