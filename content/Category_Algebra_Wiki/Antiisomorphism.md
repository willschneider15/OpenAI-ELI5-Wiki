# Antiisomorphism

Antiisomorphism is a type of mathematical relationship between two objects that are not the same, but have similar properties. It is the opposite of an isomorphism, which is a type of relationship where two objects are the same. With antiisomorphism, two objects may have the same number of elements, but they are arranged differently. For example, two triangles may have the same number of sides, but they are arranged differently. The same is true with different shapes, like squares and rectangles. Antiisomorphism is used to compare and contrast different objects, and to explore their differences.
