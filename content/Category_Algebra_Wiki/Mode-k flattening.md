# Mode-k flattening

Mode-k flattening is a way of representing data in a more organized way. It is used to make data easier to understand and analyze. 

In Mode-k flattening, data is grouped into k-dimensional arrays. Each array is then flattened into a single row or column. This makes it easier to compare data points and identify patterns. 

For example, if you have a 3-dimensional array of data, you can flatten it into a single row or column. This makes it easier to find correlations between data points and identify patterns. 

Mode-k flattening is a useful tool for data analysis. It can help you make sense of complex data sets and identify patterns that would otherwise be difficult to find.
