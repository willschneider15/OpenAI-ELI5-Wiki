# Laplacian matrix

A Laplacian matrix is a type of matrix used in graph theory. It is a square matrix that helps to measure the relationship between nodes (or vertices) in a graph. Each row and column of the matrix represent a node in the graph, and the entries in the matrix represent the edges connecting the nodes. The entries in the matrix are either 0 or a negative number, depending on the type of connection between the nodes. The sum of the entries in each row is 0, which means that the graph is balanced. Laplacian matrices are used to analyze the structure of a graph, and can be used to solve problems like finding the shortest path between two nodes.
