# Parry–Sullivan invariant

Parry–Sullivan invariant is a mathematical concept that states that if two numbers are multiplied together, the result will be the same no matter what order the numbers are multiplied in. For example, if you multiply 4 and 5 together, the result will always be 20, no matter if you multiply 4 by 5 or 5 by 4. This concept is important in mathematics because it helps simplify calculations and can be used to solve equations. It can also be used to check if a calculation is correct.
