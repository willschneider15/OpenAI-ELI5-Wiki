# Lovász conjecture

Lovász conjecture is an unsolved mathematical problem. It states that for any graph, the number of edges must be greater than or equal to the number of vertices, divided by two. This means that if a graph has 8 vertices, it must have at least 4 edges. It is a very simple idea, but it has been difficult to prove and is still unsolved. To explain it to a 5 year old, you could say that it is like a puzzle - if you have 8 pieces, you need at least 4 lines to connect them all together.
