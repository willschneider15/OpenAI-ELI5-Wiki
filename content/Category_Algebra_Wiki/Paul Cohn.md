# Paul Cohn

Paul Cohn was an American mathematician who developed the concept of "Skew Fields". Skew fields are mathematical structures that combine two operations, addition and multiplication, in a way that is not commutative. This means that the order of the operations can change the result. This concept is useful in algebra and other areas of mathematics. It helps to explain the behavior of certain equations and can be used to solve problems. Paul Cohn's work has been used in many scientific fields, including cryptography, coding theory, and quantum mechanics.
