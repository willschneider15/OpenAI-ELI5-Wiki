# Projection (linear algebra)

A projection is a way of taking a vector (or a set of vectors) and mapping it onto a different vector space. This is done by taking the dot product of the original vector and a unit vector (a vector with a magnitude of 1). The result of this dot product is a scalar which is then multiplied by the unit vector to get the projected vector. This projected vector is then in the new vector space. Projections are useful for reducing the dimensionality of a vector space, which can be helpful for visualizing and understanding data.
