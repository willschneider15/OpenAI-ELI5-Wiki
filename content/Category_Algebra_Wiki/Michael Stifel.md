# Michael Stifel

Michael Stifel was a German mathematician who lived in the 16th century. He is best known for his work on algebra and arithmetic. He developed the concept of exponents, which is a way of writing numbers that are multiplied together. Exponents are written as a number followed by a superscript, such as 2^3, which means two multiplied by itself three times. This is equal to 8. Stifel also developed the concept of logarithms, which are used to quickly calculate large numbers. Stifel's work was important in the development of modern mathematics.
