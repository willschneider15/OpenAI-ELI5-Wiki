# Fusion frame

Fusion frames are a way to combine different types of frames into one frame. This is done by combining two or more frames into a single frame. This can be done by either merging frames of the same type, or by combining frames of different types. For example, a fusion frame could be created by combining a steel frame with a carbon fiber frame. This would result in a frame that is lighter, stronger, and more durable than either of the individual frames. Fusion frames are often used in the construction of bicycles, as they provide a stronger, lighter, and more durable frame than a single frame. Fusion frames are also becoming increasingly popular in the automotive industry, as they provide a lighter and more durable frame than traditional frames.
