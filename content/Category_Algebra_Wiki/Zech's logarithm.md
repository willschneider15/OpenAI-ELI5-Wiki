# Zech's logarithm

Zech's logarithm is a type of mathematical function that is used to calculate the logarithm of a number. The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which a base number must be raised in order to produce the number. For example, if we wanted to calculate the logarithm of 8 with a base of 2, we would use Zech's logarithm to calculate that the answer is 3, because 2 to the power of 3 is 8. Zech's logarithm is useful for quickly calculating logarithms without having to do the calculations manually.
