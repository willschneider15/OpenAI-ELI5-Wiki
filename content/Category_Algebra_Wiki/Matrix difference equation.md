# Matrix difference equation

Matrix difference equations are equations that involve matrices and are used to describe the behavior of a system over time. The equations describe how the system changes from one state to the next. The equation involves matrices that represent the current state of the system and a matrix that represents the change in the system over time. The equation is then solved to find the new state of the system at the next time step. Matrix difference equations are used in many fields, including engineering, economics, and physics. They are also used to model biological systems.
