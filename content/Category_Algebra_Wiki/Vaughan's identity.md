# Vaughan's identity

Vaughan's Identity is a concept that explains how people interact with each other in a social context. It states that we all have three identities: the identity we create for ourselves, the identity that others create for us, and the identity that we create for others. 

Our own identity is the one we create for ourselves. It is the way we present ourselves to the world, and how we want to be seen. This identity is based on our values, beliefs, and goals.

The identity that others create for us is the identity that others form of us based on their interactions with us. This identity is based on how we behave, how we interact with others, and how others perceive us.

Finally, the identity that we create for others is the identity that we form for other people based on our interactions with them. This identity is based on how we see them, how we treat them, and how we view their values and beliefs.

Vaughan's Identity is an important concept to understand because it helps us to understand how we interact with others and how our identities are shaped by our interactions.
