# Classification of finite simple groups

The Classification of Finite Simple Groups is a mathematical theorem that states that all finite simple groups can be divided into a finite number of categories, called "groups". These groups are further divided into families, and each family is further divided into individual groups. The theorem states that all finite simple groups can be classified into four main groups: the alternating groups, the cyclic groups, the Lie groups, and the sporadic groups. The alternating groups are groups that can be generated by a single operation, while the cyclic groups are groups that can be generated by a single element. The Lie groups are groups that are related to the study of algebraic geometry, and the sporadic groups are groups that do not fit into any of the other categories.
