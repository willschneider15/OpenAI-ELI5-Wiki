# Weyr canonical form

Weyr canonical form is a way of representing a mathematical expression in a standard format. It is used to simplify complicated expressions and make them easier to work with. It involves writing the expression in a certain order, with parentheses and brackets to group terms together. The terms are written in a specific order, with the highest degree term first, followed by the second highest, and so on. The expression is then simplified by combining like terms and removing any redundant parentheses. Weyr canonical form can be used to solve equations, simplify expressions, and find the roots of polynomials.
