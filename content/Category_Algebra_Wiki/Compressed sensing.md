# Compressed sensing

Compressed sensing is a way of collecting data more efficiently. It works by taking fewer measurements than usual, but then using mathematics to reconstruct the original data. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that most data has patterns and structure that can be used to reconstruct it. Compressed sensing can help save time and money by reducing the amount of data that needs to be collected. It can also help reduce the amount of storage needed to store the data.
