# Walk-regular graph

A walk-regular graph is a type of graph that has a certain pattern of edges and vertices. This pattern is called a "walk" because it looks like someone is walking along the graph. In a walk-regular graph, each vertex is connected to the same number of other vertices. This means that the graph is "regular", meaning that the pattern of edges and vertices is the same throughout the entire graph. The walk-regular graph is useful for solving problems in mathematics, computer science, and other fields.
