# Rule of Sarrus

Rule of Sarrus is a mathematical rule used to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. It is named after the French mathematician, Pierre Sarrus.

The rule states that to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, you must multiply the elements in the first row, and then add the products of the elements in the second and third rows.

For example, if you have a 3x3 matrix with elements a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i, the determinant would be calculated as follows:

a * e * i + b * f * g + c * d * h - c * e * g - b * d * i - a * f * h

To explain this to a five year old, you could say that you have to multiply the numbers in the first row, then add the numbers in the second row multiplied by the numbers in the third row, and then subtract the numbers in the third row multiplied by the numbers in the second row, and then subtract the numbers in the first row multiplied by the numbers in the third row.
