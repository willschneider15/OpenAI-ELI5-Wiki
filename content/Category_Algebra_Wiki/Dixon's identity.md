# Dixon's identity

Dixon's identity is a mathematical concept that states that the sum of two cubes (or the cube of two numbers) can be expressed as the sum of two other cubes. This means that if you take two numbers, cube them, and then add the cubes together, you can also express the sum as the cubes of two other numbers. 

For example, if you take 2 cubed and 3 cubed and add them together, the sum is 33. This can also be expressed as the sum of 4 cubed and 1 cubed.

Dixon's identity is a useful concept for mathematicians and can be used to solve equations and problems. It is also a great way to show the relationship between numbers and how they can be expressed in different ways.
