# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are mathematical concepts used to describe linear transformations. An eigenvalue is a scalar (number) that describes how a linear transformation changes a vector. An eigenvector is a vector that is not changed by the linear transformation. When a linear transformation is applied to an eigenvector, it is multiplied by the eigenvalue. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to find the solutions of a system of linear equations.
