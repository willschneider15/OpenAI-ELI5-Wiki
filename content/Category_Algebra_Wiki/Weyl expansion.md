# Weyl expansion

Weyl expansion is a mathematical concept used to describe how a function behaves as it changes. It is based on the idea that a function can be broken down into a series of terms, each of which is multiplied by a coefficient. When these terms are added together, they create a new function that describes the behavior of the original function. The Weyl expansion is used to describe how a function behaves as it changes in terms of a set of coefficients and terms. The coefficients represent the relative importance of each term in the overall behavior of the function, and the terms represent the behavior of the function at different points in its domain. This expansion can be used to predict the behavior of a function as it changes, allowing for better understanding of the behavior of a function.
