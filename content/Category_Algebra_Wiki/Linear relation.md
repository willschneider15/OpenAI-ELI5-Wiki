# Linear relation

Linear relation is a mathematical concept that describes the relationship between two or more variables. It is a type of relationship where a change in one variable is associated with a proportional change in the other variable. This means that when one variable increases, the other variable decreases in a consistent, linear pattern. For example, if the price of a product increases, the demand for that product decreases in a linear pattern. Linear relations are often represented in a graph, which can be used to show the relationship between the two variables. Linear relations are also used to calculate the slope of a line, which is a measure of how steep the line is. Linear relations are used in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, algebra, and geometry.
