# A∞-operad

An A∞-operad is a mathematical structure that can be used to describe certain kinds of algebraic operations. It is made up of objects called "generators" which can be combined with each other in certain ways. These combinations are called "compositions" and they can be used to create new algebraic operations. A∞-operads are useful because they allow us to describe complicated algebraic operations in a simpler way. They can also be used to study the properties of different kinds of algebraic operations.
