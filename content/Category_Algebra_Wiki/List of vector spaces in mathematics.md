# List of vector spaces in mathematics

Vector spaces are mathematical objects that allow for the addition and scalar multiplication of elements. They are composed of vectors, which are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. A list of vector spaces is a collection of vector spaces that are related to each other in some way. For example, a list of vector spaces could include the space of all real numbers, the space of all polynomials, or the space of all matrices. These vector spaces can then be used to solve problems, such as solving systems of linear equations. Additionally, vector spaces can be used to define other mathematical objects, such as groups and rings.
