# Nagata's conjecture

Nagata's Conjecture is a mathematical statement that proposes that for any given algebraic variety, the set of points on the variety that are also algebraic points is dense. In other words, it states that if you look at a variety, then there is a point on the variety that is an algebraic point (i.e. a point that can be described using algebraic equations). 

This conjecture is important because it helps us understand the structure of algebraic varieties, which are important in many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry. It has been proven for certain special cases, but remains unproven in general.
