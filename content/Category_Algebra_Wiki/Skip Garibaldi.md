# Skip Garibaldi

Skip Garibaldi is a concept that is used to help people learn math. It is based on the idea that if you can skip count by a certain number, you can use that number to help you solve math problems. For example, if you can skip count by 3, you can use that number to help you solve addition problems. This concept is used to help children learn math in a fun and interactive way. By using skip counting, children can learn the basics of addition and subtraction and build a strong foundation for more complex math problems.
