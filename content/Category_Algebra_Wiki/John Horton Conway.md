# John Horton Conway

John Horton Conway is a mathematician who is famous for inventing the Game of Life. The Game of Life is a computer simulation of a world made up of little cells that live and die according to a few simple rules. The cells can move around and interact with each other, and depending on how they interact, they can create complex patterns. It's an interesting way to explore the idea that simple rules can lead to complex behavior.
