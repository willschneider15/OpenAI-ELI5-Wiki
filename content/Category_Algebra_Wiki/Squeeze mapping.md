# Squeeze mapping

Squeeze mapping is a way of making a map easier to read. It is done by reducing the size of the map so that all the important information can be seen in one view. This is done by removing unnecessary details and using a more simplified design. Squeeze mapping makes it easier to see the relationships between different features on a map, such as roads, rivers, and landmarks. This can be helpful when trying to plan a route or find a location. Squeeze mapping can also be used to make a map easier to understand by reducing the amount of text and symbols on the map.
