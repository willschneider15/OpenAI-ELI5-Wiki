# Semi-symmetric graph

A semi-symmetric graph is a type of graph in which the edges are symmetrically arranged around a central vertex. This means that for every edge connecting two vertices, there is a corresponding edge connecting the same two vertices in the opposite direction. In other words, the graph is undirected, but the edges are arranged in such a way that the graph looks symmetrical. Semi-symmetric graphs are useful in applications such as network topology, where symmetrical arrangements of nodes can help increase efficiency.
