# Zero-product property

Zero-product property is a mathematical rule that states that if the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the two numbers must be zero. This property is important because it helps us solve equations. For example, if we have an equation like `2x + 6 = 0`, we can use the zero-product property to solve it. Since the product of `2x` and `6` is zero, we know that either `2x` or `6` must be zero. In this case, `2x` must be zero, so we can solve for `x` by dividing both sides of the equation by `2` to get `x = -3`.
