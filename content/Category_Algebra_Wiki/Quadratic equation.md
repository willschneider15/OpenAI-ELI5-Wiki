# Quadratic equation

A Quadratic equation is a type of equation that involves a variable, usually x, which is squared (multiplied by itself) and is also multiplied by another number. The equation looks like this: 

`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

where a, b, and c are numbers. To solve a quadratic equation, you have to figure out what x is. To do this, you can use the Quadratic Formula, which looks like this: 

`x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a`

You can also use factoring to solve the equation. This means that you have to figure out what two numbers multiplied together equal the number in front of the x2 (a). Then, you can use those two numbers to rewrite the equation so that it can be solved.

Quadratic equations are important because they help us understand the world around us. They can be used to model physical phenomena such as the motion of a pendulum or the path of a projectile. They can also be used to solve problems in business, engineering, and other fields.
