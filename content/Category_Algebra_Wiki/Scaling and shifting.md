# Scaling and shifting

Scaling and shifting are mathematical concepts used to change the size and position of a graph. 

Scaling is when you make a graph bigger or smaller. You can do this by multiplying the x-values and y-values on the graph by a number. This will make the graph bigger or smaller depending on the number you use.

Shifting is when you move a graph up, down, left, or right. You can do this by adding or subtracting a number to the x-values or y-values on the graph. This will move the graph up, down, left, or right depending on the number you use.

Scaling and shifting are useful for transforming graphs so that they can be compared or analyzed more easily.
