# Cubic equation

A cubic equation is an equation that contains a variable (x) raised to the third power. It looks like this: 

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

where a, b, c, and d are numbers. To solve a cubic equation, you need to find the value of x that makes the equation true. This can be done by using algebraic methods, such as factoring and completing the square. In some cases, you may need to use a calculator or computer to find the exact solution.

Cubic equations are important because they can be used to model many real-world phenomena, such as the motion of a pendulum or the relationship between pressure and volume in a gas. Understanding how to solve them can help you in many areas of mathematics and science.
