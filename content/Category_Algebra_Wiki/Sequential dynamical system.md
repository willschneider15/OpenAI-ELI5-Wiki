# Sequential dynamical system

A Sequential Dynamical System (SDS) is a mathematical model that describes how a system changes over time. It is a type of discrete dynamical system, meaning that the system is represented by a sequence of values that can be calculated from the previous values. The sequence of values is often referred to as a trajectory, and the changes in the trajectory over time are determined by a set of equations called the system's equations. SDSs are used to model a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems, and can be used to predict future behavior.
