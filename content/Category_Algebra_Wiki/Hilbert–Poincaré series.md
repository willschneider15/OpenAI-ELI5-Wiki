# Hilbert–Poincaré series

Hilbert–Poincaré series is a mathematical tool used to measure the size of a set of objects. It works by counting the number of objects in the set, then dividing it by the total number of objects in the set. This gives a fraction that can be used to compare the size of different sets. For example, if one set has two objects and another set has four objects, the Hilbert–Poincaré series will show that the second set is twice as big as the first set. This can be used to compare sets of any size, making it a very useful tool for mathematicians.
