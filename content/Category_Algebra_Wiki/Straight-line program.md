# Straight-line program

Straight-line programming is a type of computer programming in which instructions are executed in the same order as they are written. This type of programming is relatively simple, as it requires no decision-making or branching logic. Instead, the program executes each instruction in sequence and the program ends when it reaches the last instruction.

Straight-line programming is useful for simple tasks, such as basic calculations and data manipulation. For more complex tasks, such as sorting data or performing complex calculations, a more advanced programming language is usually required. Straight-line programs can also be used to create simple user interfaces and automated processes.
