# Vector calculus identities

Vector calculus identities are equations that describe relationships between various vector calculus operations. These identities are used to determine how a vector field will behave under certain conditions, such as when two or more vector fields interact. Vector calculus identities can also be used to find solutions to vector calculus problems. Some of the most common vector calculus identities include the divergence theorem, the curl theorem, and the Stokes’ theorem. The divergence theorem states that the divergence of a vector field is equal to the sum of the outward flux of the vector field through a surface. The curl theorem states that the curl of a vector field is equal to the sum of the circulation of the vector field around a closed loop. Finally, Stokes’ theorem states that the circulation of a vector field around a closed loop is equal to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field over the surface. These identities are important for understanding and solving vector calculus problems.
