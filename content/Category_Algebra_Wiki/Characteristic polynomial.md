# Characteristic polynomial

The characteristic polynomial of a matrix is a polynomial equation that describes the properties of the matrix. It is found by taking the determinant of the matrix minus a variable multiplied by the identity matrix. The roots of the polynomial give information about the eigenvalues of the matrix, which in turn can be used to determine the stability of the matrix. The characteristic polynomial can also be used to calculate the trace and determinant of the matrix. Characteristic polynomials are important in linear algebra, as they allow for the analysis of matrices.
