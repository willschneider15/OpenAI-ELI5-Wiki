# Cover (algebra)

Cover is a concept in algebra that describes how two sets of numbers can be combined to form a larger set. It is often used to describe how two sets of numbers can be used to create a new set that includes all of the numbers from both sets. For example, if you had two sets of numbers, A and B, you could combine them to create a new set, C, that contains all of the numbers from both A and B. Cover is a useful tool for understanding how different sets of numbers can be combined to form larger sets.
