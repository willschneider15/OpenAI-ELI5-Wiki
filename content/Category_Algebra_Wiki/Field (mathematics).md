# Field (mathematics)

Fields are mathematical structures that contain a set of numbers and operations that can be performed on them. Fields are useful for studying abstract algebra, which is the study of mathematical structures.

Fields are composed of two parts: a set of numbers and a set of operations. The set of numbers is usually a set of real or complex numbers, but it can also be any set of numbers that can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. The set of operations is a set of rules that describe how the numbers in the set can be combined. 

Fields are used to study abstract algebra, which is the study of mathematical structures. Fields can also be used to study equations and other mathematical problems. They can help us understand how numbers interact with each other and how equations can be solved.
