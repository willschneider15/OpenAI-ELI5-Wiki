# System of linear equations

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations that use the same set of variables. The equations can be written in the form of an augmented matrix, where the coefficients of the variables are placed in the matrix and the constants are placed in a separate column. The solutions of a system of linear equations can be found by using various methods, such as Gaussian elimination, Cramer's rule, or matrix inversion. In general, the solution of a system of linear equations is a set of values for each variable that makes all of the equations true.
