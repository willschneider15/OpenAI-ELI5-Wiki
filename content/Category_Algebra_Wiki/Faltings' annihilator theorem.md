# Faltings' annihilator theorem

Faltings' annihilator theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that given any algebraic equation, there exists a number that can make the equation equal to zero. This number is called an annihilator. The theorem was first proposed by mathematician Gerd Faltings in 1983.

An algebraic equation is a mathematical equation that contains one or more variables. An annihilator is a number that can be used to make the equation equal to zero. To find the annihilator, you must solve the equation for the variable and then substitute the number that makes the equation equal to zero.

Faltings' annihilator theorem is useful for solving many types of equations. It can help us to find the exact value of a variable in an equation, or to determine whether a certain equation has a solution or not. It is also useful for finding the roots of a polynomial equation.
