# Sum of radicals

The Sum of Radicals is a mathematical concept that involves taking two or more radical expressions and combining them into one expression. This is done by adding the coefficients and combining the radicals. The coefficients are the numbers or constants that are multiplied by the radicals. The radicals are the square roots, cube roots, and other root expressions that are used in algebraic equations.

For example, if you have two radical expressions, one with a coefficient of 3 and a radical of √2, and the other with a coefficient of 4 and a radical of √3, then the sum of radicals would be 7√2 + 4√3.

The Sum of Radicals is a useful tool for simplifying equations and solving problems. It can help reduce the number of steps needed to solve a problem, making it easier to understand and visualize. It can also be used to solve equations that have multiple radical expressions, such as quadratic equations.

In conclusion, the Sum of Radicals is a mathematical concept that involves combining two or more radical expressions into one expression by adding the coefficients and combining the radicals. It is a useful tool for simplifying equations and solving problems.
