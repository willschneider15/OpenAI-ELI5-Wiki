# Graph automorphism

Graph automorphism is a concept that describes how two graphs can be the same even though they look different. This means that the two graphs have the same structure, but the order of the vertices and the edges may be different. For example, if you have two graphs with the same number of vertices and edges, then they are said to be graph automorphisms of each other. This concept can be explained to a 5 year old by saying that two graphs can be the same even though they look different, like two people who look different but are twins.
