# Pierre Samuel

Pierre Samuel was a French philosopher who believed that the only way to achieve a just and equitable society was through the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He argued that these principles should be the basis for all laws, and that all citizens should be treated equally regardless of their social class or wealth. He also believed that the government should be run by the people, and that it should be accountable to them. He argued that the government should be transparent and that it should provide a level playing field for all citizens. He also believed that the government should be responsible for providing basic services such as education and health care. He believed that everyone should have the right to pursue their own interests and that the government should not interfere with their decisions.
