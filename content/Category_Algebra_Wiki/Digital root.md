# Digital root

Digital root is a concept in mathematics that involves taking a number and adding its digits together until a single digit is reached. For example, if you have the number 150, you would add 1 + 5 + 0 to get 6, which is the digital root. This concept can be applied to any number, no matter how big or small.

Digital root can be used to check the validity of a number. For example, if you have a number and its digital root is 9, you know that the number is divisible by 9. It can also be used to check the divisibility of other numbers.

Digital root can also be used to create patterns. For example, if you take the digital root of any multiple of 9, the result will be 9. This pattern can be used to create puzzles and games.

Overall, digital root is an interesting concept that can be used to check the validity of numbers and create patterns. It is a fun way to explore math and can be used to create puzzles and games.
