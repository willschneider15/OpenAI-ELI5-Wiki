# Max August Zorn

Max August Zorn was a German mathematician who developed a theorem in 1935. His theorem states that if a set of real numbers is partially ordered, then it contains at least one maximal element. This means that if you look at a set of numbers, there will always be a number that is larger than all the others. This is known as the "Zorn's Lemma". It is an important concept in mathematics and can be used to prove many mathematical theorems. Zorn's Lemma is also used in computer science, particularly in algorithms and data structures. It can be used to prove the correctness of certain algorithms, and it is also used in game theory. 

Zorn's Lemma is an important concept in mathematics and computer science, and it is named after Max August Zorn because he was the first to discover it.
