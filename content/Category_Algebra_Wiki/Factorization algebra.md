# Factorization algebra

Factorization algebra is a way of breaking down a number into its prime factors. It is used to simplify equations and help find the greatest common factor (GCF) between two numbers.

To factorize a number, you start by finding the prime factors of that number. Prime factors are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one. Then, you break down the number into those prime factors, usually in the form of multiplication. For example, the number 24 can be broken down into the prime factors 2 and 3, so 24 = 2 x 3 x 2 x 2.

Factorization algebra is a helpful tool because it allows us to quickly find the GCF of two numbers. To find the GCF, you just need to look at the prime factors of each number and find the ones they have in common. For example, if you have the numbers 24 and 16, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 2 for 24 and 2 and 2 for 16. The prime factors they have in common are 2 and 2, so the GCF of 24 and 16 is 4.
