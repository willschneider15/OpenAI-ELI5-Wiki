# Row equivalence

Row equivalence is a concept used in mathematics to describe two rows of a matrix that are equal. It means that the two rows have the same elements in the same order, and the same number of elements. For example, if two rows of a matrix are row equivalent, then the first row has the same number of elements as the second row, and the elements in the first row are the same as the elements in the second row, but in a different order. 

Row equivalence is useful in solving linear equations, because it allows us to reduce the number of equations that need to be solved. For example, if two rows of a matrix are row equivalent, then they can be combined into one row, which simplifies the equation.
