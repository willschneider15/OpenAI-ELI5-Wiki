# Matlis duality

Matlis duality is a concept in mathematics that relates two different algebraic objects. It states that if one object satisfies certain conditions, then so does the other object. For example, if one object is a vector space, then the other object is its dual vector space. Matlis duality helps to simplify calculations and proofs in algebraic geometry and linear algebra. It also helps to understand how two different objects can be related to each other. Matlis duality is an important concept in mathematics and can be used to solve many problems.
