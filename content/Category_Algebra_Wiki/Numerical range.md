# Numerical range

Numerical range is a concept in linear algebra that describes the set of all possible values of a matrix or vector. It is also known as the field of values or the spectrum of a matrix. It is used to analyze the behavior of a matrix or vector under certain operations, such as multiplication or addition. The numerical range of a matrix is the set of all possible values of the matrix when it is multiplied by a vector. It is important to note that the numerical range of a matrix is not necessarily the same as the range of its entries. The numerical range is always a subset of the range of the entries. The numerical range is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix and can be calculated using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. The numerical range is a useful tool in linear algebra and can be used to analyze the behavior of a matrix under certain operations.
