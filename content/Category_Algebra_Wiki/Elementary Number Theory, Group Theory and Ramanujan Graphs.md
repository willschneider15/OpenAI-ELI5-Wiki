# Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory and Ramanujan Graphs

**Elementary Number Theory:** Elementary Number Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of numbers and the relationships between them. It focuses on the study of prime numbers, divisibility, congruences, and modular arithmetic.

**Group Theory:** Group Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of algebraic structures called groups. It focuses on the study of symmetry, abstract algebra, and the application of group theory to other areas of mathematics.

**Ramanujan Graphs:** Ramanujan Graphs are a type of graph that has high connectivity and low diameter. They are named after the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan and are used in many areas of mathematics, including graph theory, number theory, and computer science.
