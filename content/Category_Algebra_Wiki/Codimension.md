# Codimension

Codimension is a concept in mathematics that describes the difference between two spaces. It is the number of dimensions that one space has more than the other. For example, if one space has three dimensions (length, width, and height) and the other space has two dimensions (length and width), then the codimension of the first space is one. 

Codimension is useful for understanding the relationship between different spaces and can help us visualize how they interact. It can also help us understand how different shapes or objects fit together. For example, if a cube has a codimension of two, then it can fit into a two-dimensional space, such as a flat surface.
