# John von Neumann

John von Neumann was a mathematician and scientist who made major contributions to many areas of science and technology. He is best known for his work on the mathematical foundations of computers and computer programming. He developed the idea of a stored-program computer, which is a computer that stores instructions in its memory. This allowed computers to be more versatile and efficient, as they could store and execute instructions without having to be re-programmed each time a task was changed. He also developed the concept of game theory, which is used to analyze strategic decision making. His work had a major influence on the development of modern computers and computing technology.
