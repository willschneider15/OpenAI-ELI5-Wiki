# Symbolic integration

Symbolic integration is a way to solve mathematical equations. It uses symbols and equations to solve problems that would be too complicated to do by hand. Symbolic integration is used to find the area under a curve, calculate derivatives, and solve differential equations. Symbolic integration is a powerful tool that can be used in many different fields, such as engineering, physics, and economics. Symbolic integration can be used to solve problems that would be too difficult or time-consuming to solve with traditional methods. Symbolic integration can be used to solve equations that involve multiple variables, and can even be used to solve equations with unknown variables. Symbolic integration is an important tool for scientists and engineers who need to solve complex equations quickly and accurately.
