# Monomial basis

A monomial basis is a set of polynomial functions used to describe a mathematical system. It is a type of basis function, which is a function that can be used to represent any other function. The monomial basis consists of all polynomials of a certain degree, and each polynomial is a combination of powers of a single variable. For example, a monomial basis of degree two would be composed of all polynomials of the form axÂ² + bx + c. The coefficients (a, b, and c) determine the shape of the polynomial. The monomial basis is useful for approximating functions and solving equations.
