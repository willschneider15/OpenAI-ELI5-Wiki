# Consistent and inconsistent equations

Consistent equations are equations that have a solution. They can be solved using the same method and will have a single answer. An example of a consistent equation is x + 2 = 4. This equation can be solved by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, giving us x = 2.

Inconsistent equations, on the other hand, do not have a solution. This is because the two sides of the equation cannot be equal. An example of an inconsistent equation is x + 2 = 5 and x + 2 = 3. No matter what value is assigned to x, the two sides of the equation will never be equal.
