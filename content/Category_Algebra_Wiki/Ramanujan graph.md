# Ramanujan graph

Ramanujan graphs are highly connected graphs that are used to model complex networks. They are named after the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who first proposed the concept in the early 20th century.

Ramanujan graphs are constructed by connecting each node to every other node in the graph with a certain probability. This probability is chosen so that the graph has a high degree of connectivity. This means that each node is connected to many other nodes, and there are relatively few isolated nodes.

Ramanujan graphs are useful for modeling real-world networks such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks. They are also used in the study of network algorithms and graph theory.

Ramanujan graphs are an important tool for understanding the structure of complex networks. They can provide insights into the behavior of networks and help improve the efficiency of network algorithms.
