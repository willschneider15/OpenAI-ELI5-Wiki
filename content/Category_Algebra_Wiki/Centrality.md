# Centrality

Centrality is a measure of how important a node is in a network. It is calculated by looking at how many connections it has to other nodes in the network, and how strong those connections are. The more connections and the stronger the connections, the higher the centrality of the node. Centrality is important because it can help identify the most influential nodes in a network. It can also help identify the most important paths through the network, which can be used to understand how information and resources flow through the network.
