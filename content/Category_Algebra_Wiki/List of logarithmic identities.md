# List of logarithmic identities

Logarithmic identities are equations that involve logarithms. They are used to simplify equations that involve logarithms, and they can be used to solve equations involving logarithms.

The most common logarithmic identities are:

1. Product Rule: log<sub>a</sub>(xy) = log<sub>a</sub>(x) + log<sub>a</sub>(y)

2. Quotient Rule: log<sub>a</sub>(x/y) = log<sub>a</sub>(x) - log<sub>a</sub>(y)

3. Power Rule: log<sub>a</sub>(x<sup>n</sup>) = n Ã— log<sub>a</sub>(x)

4. Change of Base Rule: log<sub>a</sub>(x) = log<sub>b</sub>(x) / log<sub>b</sub>(a)

These identities can be used to solve equations that involve logarithms, and they can also be used to simplify equations that involve logarithms. Knowing these identities
