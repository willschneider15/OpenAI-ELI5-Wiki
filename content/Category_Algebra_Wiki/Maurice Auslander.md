# Maurice Auslander

Maurice Auslander was a mathematician who developed the concept of Auslander-Reiten theory. This theory is used in algebraic geometry and representation theory. It is a way of understanding the relationship between different objects in a mathematical system.

In simple terms, Auslander-Reiten theory is a way of looking at how objects interact in a mathematical system. It is used to help us understand the connections between different objects and to make predictions about how they might interact. Auslander's work helped to further our understanding of algebraic geometry and representation theory.
