# Haran's diamond theorem

Haran's diamond theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that a triangle is a diamond if and only if the sum of its angles is equal to 180 degrees. This theorem was developed by mathematician Haran in the year 2000.

The theorem can be used to prove the correctness of a geometric construction or to prove the existence of some geometric shapes. It is also useful in solving problems related to geometry.

In simple terms, the theorem states that if the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, then the triangle is a diamond. If the sum is not 180 degrees, then the triangle is not a diamond. This theorem is also known as the “180-degree theorem”.

Haran's diamond theorem is an important concept in geometry and is used to prove many geometric facts. It is a useful tool for solving problems related to geometry and can be used to prove the correctness of a geometric construction.
