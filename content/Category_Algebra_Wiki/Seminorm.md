# Seminorm

A seminorm is a type of mathematical function that measures the size of a vector. It is similar to a norm, but it does not have to satisfy all the properties of a norm. For example, it does not have to be positive, and it does not have to satisfy the triangle inequality. Seminorms are often used in vector spaces to measure the size of vectors, and they can be used to measure the distance between two points in a vector space.
