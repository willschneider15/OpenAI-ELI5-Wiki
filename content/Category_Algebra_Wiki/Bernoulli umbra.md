# Bernoulli umbra

A Bernoulli umbra is a type of probability experiment that is used to model the behavior of a random variable. It is named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, who developed the concept in the 17th century. In a Bernoulli trial, a single event is observed and the outcome is either a success or a failure. The probability of success is known as the Bernoulli parameter.

In a Bernoulli umbra, a series of repeated Bernoulli trials is observed. The probability of success in each trial is the same and the outcomes of each trial are independent of each other. The probability of success in a Bernoulli umbra is the same as the Bernoulli parameter.

A Bernoulli umbra can be used to model a variety of situations, such as the probability of getting heads or tails when flipping a coin, the probability of winning a game of chance, or the probability of a customer making a purchase. It can also be used to model the behavior of a stock market, or the probability of a certain event occurring.
