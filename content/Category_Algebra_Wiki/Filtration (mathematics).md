# Filtration (mathematics)

Filtration is a mathematical concept used to describe a process of separating items or data into different groups. It can be used to organize or simplify a large amount of data into manageable categories. 

For example, if you have a list of numbers, you can use filtration to separate the numbers into different groups based on criteria you choose. You might separate the numbers into even and odd numbers, or you might separate them into groups of 10. 

Filtration is also used in computer programming, where it can be used to filter out unnecessary data from a large set of data. This can help make it easier to find the data you need.
