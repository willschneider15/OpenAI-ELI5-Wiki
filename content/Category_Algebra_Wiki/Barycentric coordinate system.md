# Barycentric coordinate system

Barycentric coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the coordinates of a point are expressed as a weighted sum of the coordinates of three other points. It is used to describe the location of a point relative to three other points, which are known as the vertices of a triangle. The coordinates of a point in a barycentric coordinate system are expressed as a triplet of numbers, each of which is the ratio of the distance of the point from one of the vertices to the sum of the distances of the point from all three vertices. This triplet can be used to represent the relative position of the point with respect to the three vertices. Barycentric coordinates are useful in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as they allow for the description of a point relative to a triangle in a simple and convenient way.
