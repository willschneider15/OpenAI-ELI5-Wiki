# Solution in radicals

Solution in radicals is a concept used to solve equations with square roots and higher-order roots. It involves using the properties of radicals to simplify an equation and eventually solve it.

The basic idea of a solution in radicals is to isolate the radical on one side of the equation and then use the properties of radicals to simplify the equation. This includes using the product rule, quotient rule, and power rule to simplify the equation. Once the equation is simplified, the radical can be isolated and the equation can be solved.

The solution in radicals can be used to solve equations with square roots, cube roots, and higher-order roots. It is important to remember the properties of radicals when solving equations with radicals. This includes the product rule, quotient rule, and power rule. With these rules, the equation can be simplified and solved.
