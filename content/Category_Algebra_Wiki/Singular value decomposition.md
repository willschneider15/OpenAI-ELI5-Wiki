# Singular value decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique used to break down a matrix into its constituent parts. It can be used to reduce the complexity of a matrix and make it easier to understand. 

SVD takes a matrix and decomposes it into three smaller matrices - U, S, and V. U and V are orthogonal matrices, while S is a diagonal matrix. U and V contain the eigenvectors of the original matrix, while S contains the corresponding eigenvalues. 

The decomposition can be used to reduce the complexity of the original matrix and to identify the most important components of the data. This can be useful for data compression, data analysis, and machine learning.
