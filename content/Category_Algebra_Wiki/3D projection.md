# 3D projection

3D projection is a way of creating a three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional surface. It is used in a variety of applications, such as movies, video games, and virtual reality. In 3D projection, a three-dimensional object is projected onto a two-dimensional surface, such as a movie screen or computer monitor. The projection is created by mapping the 3D object onto the 2D surface. This process is known as "ray tracing" and involves tracing the path of light rays from the 3D object to the 2D surface. The result is an image that appears to be three-dimensional, even though it is actually two-dimensional. 3D projection can be used to create stunning visuals and immersive experiences, making it an important tool in the world of entertainment.
