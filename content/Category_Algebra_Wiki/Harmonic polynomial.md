# Harmonic polynomial

Harmonic polynomials are mathematical expressions that can be used to describe the behavior of certain physical systems. They are usually composed of a combination of sine and cosine functions, and can be used to model wave-like behaviors like sound, light, and electricity. Harmonic polynomials are often used in engineering and physics to predict the behavior of systems. They are also used in signal processing, such as audio and video, to filter out noise and create smoother signals. Harmonic polynomials are an important tool for understanding the behavior of physical systems.
