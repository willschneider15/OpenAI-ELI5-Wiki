# Schur product theorem

Schur Product Theorem states that the product of two matrices is equal to the product of their element-wise products. This means that if you have two matrices A and B of the same size, then the product of A and B (A x B) is equal to the element-wise product of A and B (A .* B). This theorem is useful in linear algebra because it allows us to quickly calculate the product of two matrices without having to use traditional matrix multiplication.
