# Aitken interpolation

Aitken interpolation is a method of estimating values between two known points. It works by taking two known points and using them to create a line of best fit. Then, any other points that fall on the line can be estimated by using the equation of the line. This method is useful for finding values that are not known, but are related to known values. It can also be used to smooth out data points that are not exact. Aitken interpolation is a simple and efficient way to estimate values without having to do complex calculations.
