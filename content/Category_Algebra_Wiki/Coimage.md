# Coimage

Coimage is a way of sharing digital images online. It's like a photo album, but instead of physical pictures, it's made up of digital images. You can store, share, and organize your pictures in Coimage. You can also add tags and descriptions to your photos, so you can easily find them later. With Coimage, you can share your photos with friends and family, or even with the whole world. It's a great way to show off your work, and keep your memories alive!
