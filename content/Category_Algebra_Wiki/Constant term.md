# Constant term

A constant term is a type of mathematical term that does not change or vary, regardless of the circumstances. It is a fixed value, and can be represented as a number, variable, or expression. The constant term is usually denoted by a letter, such as "c".

For example, the equation y = 3x + c is a linear equation with a constant term of c. The value of c does not change, even if the values for x and y change. It is a fixed value that is added to the equation regardless of what the other terms are.

Constant terms are used in equations to represent a fixed value that does not change. They are also used in algebraic expressions to represent a number that is not affected by the other terms. Constant terms are used to simplify equations and make them easier to solve.
