# Lattice reduction

Lattice reduction is a mathematical technique used to reduce the size of a lattice, which is a type of mathematical structure made up of points and lines. It is used to simplify large equations or problems, making them easier to solve. The idea is to remove unnecessary points or lines from the lattice, leaving behind only the essential elements that are needed to solve the problem. This process reduces the size of the lattice, making it easier to work with. Lattice reduction can be used in many different areas, such as cryptography, coding theory, and number theory.
