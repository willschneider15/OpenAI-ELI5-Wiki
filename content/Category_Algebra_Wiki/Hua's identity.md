# Hua's identity

Hua's identity is a concept developed by Chinese American author and cultural critic Frank H. Wu. It is an idea of what it means to be Chinese American, and how to navigate the cultural and racial boundaries that exist between the two cultures. Hua's identity is based on the idea that Chinese Americans are not simply an ethnic minority, but a unique cultural group with its own distinct identity. This identity is based on the idea that Chinese Americans are both Chinese and American, and must reconcile the two cultures in order to fully embrace their identity. Hua's identity also emphasizes the importance of understanding and accepting both cultures, as well as the importance of maintaining a strong connection to one's Chinese heritage. By embracing Hua's identity, Chinese Americans can better understand and appreciate their own identity, as well as the cultural and racial boundaries that exist between them.
