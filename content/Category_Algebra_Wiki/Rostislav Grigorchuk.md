# Rostislav Grigorchuk

Rostislav Grigorchuk is a mathematician who is known for his work in group theory. He discovered the first example of a group with intermediate growth, which means that it grows at a rate that is slower than exponential growth, but faster than polynomial growth. He also discovered the first example of an infinite group that has a finite number of generators. This discovery has had a major impact on the study of group theory and has led to further research in the field. In addition, Grigorchuk has made other contributions to mathematics, such as his work on self-similar groups and the construction of automata. He has been honored with awards such as the Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the European Mathematical Society Prize.
