Physical refers to taking care of your body by eating healthy and exercising regularly. Mental refers to developing your skills and knowledge so that you can reach your goals. Emotional refers to understanding and managing your emotions so that you can stay positive and motivated. Lastly, spiritual refers to understanding and connecting with your inner self and values.
