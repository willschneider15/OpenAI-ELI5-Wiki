# Pointwise product

Pointwise product is a type of mathematical operation used to multiply two vectors together. It involves multiplying each element of one vector with the corresponding element of the other vector. The result of the operation is a new vector with the same number of elements as the original vectors. Each element of the new vector is the product of the corresponding elements of the original vectors. This type of product is useful for a variety of applications, including machine learning and signal processing. It is also used in linear algebra to solve systems of equations.
