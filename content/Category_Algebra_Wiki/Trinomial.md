# Trinomial

A trinomial is a mathematical expression that contains three terms. These terms can be numbers, variables, or a combination of both. For example, a trinomial might look like this: `2x^2 + 7x + 3`. 

The three terms are usually separated by addition or subtraction symbols. The first term is usually the highest power of the variable (in this example, it is `2x^2`). The second term is usually the middle power of the variable (in this example, it is `7x`). The third term is usually the lowest power of the variable (in this example, it is `3`). 

Trinomials are often used to solve problems in algebra and calculus. For example, if you want to find the roots of a trinomial, you can use a process called factoring. This process involves breaking the trinomial down into factors, which are then used to solve the equation. 

In conclusion, a trinomial is a mathematical expression that contains three terms. It is often used to solve problems in algebra and calculus.
