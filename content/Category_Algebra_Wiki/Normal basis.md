# Normal basis

Normal basis is a concept in linear algebra that describes a set of vectors that form a basis for a vector space. It is also known as an orthonormal basis, because the vectors in the set are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other and have a length of one. 

The normal basis is important because it is used to describe the structure of a vector space. By using the normal basis, we can represent any vector in the space as a linear combination of the basis vectors. This makes it easier to work with vectors and perform calculations. 

Normal bases can also be used to find the inverse of a matrix. The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that can be used to undo the effect of the original matrix. By using the normal basis, we can easily find the inverse of a matrix.
