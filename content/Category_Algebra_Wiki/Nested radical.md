# Nested radical

Nested radicals are a type of mathematical expression that involve taking the square root of a number multiple times. For example, a nested radical expression might look like this: √a + √b + √c. In this case, the expression is taking the square root of a, then adding it to the square root of b, and then adding it to the square root of c.

Nested radicals can be used to calculate the approximate value of irrational numbers, or numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction. For example, the number pi (3.14159...) is an irrational number, and can be approximated using nested radicals.

Nested radicals can also be used to simplify complex equations. By breaking down a complex equation into a series of nested radicals, it can be easier to solve.

Nested radicals are an important concept in mathematics, and can be used to calculate approximate values and simplify equations.
