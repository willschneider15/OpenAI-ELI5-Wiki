# Integration by parts

Integration by parts is a method used to solve integrals. It involves breaking down an integral into two parts and then integrating each part separately. The two parts are called the "integrand" and the "antiderivative". The integrand is the part of the integral that will be integrated and the antiderivative is the part that will be differentiated. The idea behind integration by parts is to use the product rule to transform the integral into something that can be solved more easily. The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions is equal to the derivative of the first function multiplied by the second function plus the first function multiplied by the derivative of the second function. This is used to rewrite the integral so that one of the two parts can be integrated more easily. After both parts have been integrated, the two results are added together to get the final answer. Integration by parts is a useful tool for solving integrals that cannot be solved using other methods.
