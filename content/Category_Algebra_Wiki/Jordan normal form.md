# Jordan normal form

Jordan normal form is a way of representing a matrix in a simplified form. It is a type of canonical form that is used in linear algebra. It is used to help simplify and solve linear equations.

The matrix is written in a block-diagonal form with each block being a Jordan block. A Jordan block is a square matrix that has all of its entries equal to zero except for the ones on the main diagonal and the ones directly above it.

The Jordan normal form is useful because it can be used to determine the eigenvalues of a matrix. It can also be used to calculate the rank, trace, and determinant of a matrix. It is also used to solve systems of linear equations.

Overall, Jordan normal form is a useful tool for linear algebra and can be used to simplify and solve many problems.
