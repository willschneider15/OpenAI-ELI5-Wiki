# Clustering coefficient

Clustering coefficient is a measure of how well connected a node (or a group of nodes) is in a network. It measures the degree to which a node is connected to other nodes that are connected to each other. The higher the clustering coefficient, the more connected the node is. The clustering coefficient can help us understand how well a network is connected and how well it is organized. It also helps us to identify communities within a network.
