# Dual number

Dual numbers are a type of number system that is used in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. They are a combination of two numbers, an ordinary number and an infinitesimal number. The ordinary number is the real number, while the infinitesimal number is a number that is so small that it can be considered to be zero.

Dual numbers are used to represent derivatives, and can be used to find derivatives of functions, as well as to solve equations involving derivatives. This is done by representing the derivative of a function as a dual number, and then manipulating the dual number to solve the equation.

Dual numbers can also be used to represent rotations in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. They are used to represent the angle of rotation, and can be used to calculate the effects of a rotation on a vector.

Finally, dual numbers can be used to represent complex numbers. This is done by representing the real part of the complex number as the ordinary number, and the imaginary part as the infinitesimal number. This makes it easier to work with complex numbers, and can be used to solve equations involving complex numbers.
