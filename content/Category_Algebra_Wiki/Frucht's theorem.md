# Frucht's theorem

Frucht's theorem states that any two graphs with the same number of vertices that are not isomorphic must have a different number of symmetries. A graph is a collection of points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting them. Isomorphic graphs are graphs that are the same, but with different labels. Symmetry is when the graph looks the same no matter how it is rotated or flipped.

In other words, Frucht's theorem says that if two graphs have the same number of points and lines, but are not the same, then they must have a different number of symmetries. This theorem helps us understand the structure of graphs and how they are related to each other.
