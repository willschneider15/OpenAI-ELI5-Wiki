# Word problem (mathematics)

Word problems in mathematics are problems that require the use of mathematics to solve a real-world problem. These problems often require the use of equations, algebra, and problem-solving skills. Word problems are often used to assess a student's understanding of a concept or to assess their problem-solving skills.

Word problems involve a real-world scenario that requires the student to identify the mathematical concepts that are relevant to the problem. The student must then use their knowledge of mathematics to formulate an equation that will solve the problem. This equation must then be solved using algebraic or other methods to produce the answer.

Word problems are an important part of mathematics education as they help students to develop their problem-solving skills, as well as their understanding of mathematical concepts. Word problems can also help to make mathematics more accessible to students, as they can provide a context that is more relatable to students than abstract equations.
