# List of trigonometric identities

Trigonometric identities are equations that involve trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine, and tangent. These identities can be used to simplify equations and solve problems. For example, the Pythagorean identity states that the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of an angle is equal to one. This can be used to solve for an angle if the sine and cosine are known. 

List of trigonometric identities are collections of equations that involve trigonometric functions. These identities can be used to simplify and solve equations. They are often used in calculus, geometry, and physics. Some of the most common identities include the Pythagorean identity, the sum and difference identities, the double angle identities, and the half angle identities. 

Overall, trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions. They are used to simplify and solve equations. List of trigonometric identities provide a collection of equations that can be used in calculus, geometry, and physics.
