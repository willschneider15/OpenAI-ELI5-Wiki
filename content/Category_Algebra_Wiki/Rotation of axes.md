# Rotation of axes

Rotation of axes is a process of transforming a coordinate system to a new coordinate system. This transformation is achieved by rotating the original coordinate system around a certain point. The new coordinate system is defined by a new set of axes that are perpendicular to the original axes. This rotation of axes can be used to simplify a mathematical problem or to better understand a physical system. For example, a rotation of axes can be used to convert a 3D system into a 2D system, which is easier to solve. Additionally, a rotation of axes can be used to change the orientation of a physical system. This can be used to make a system easier to visualize or to align the system with a certain reference frame. In summary, rotation of axes is a process of transforming a coordinate system that can be used to simplify a problem or to better understand a physical system.
