# Bochner identity

Bochner Identity is a mathematical formula that describes how certain functions can be expressed as the sum of a function and its Fourier transform. It is an important concept in mathematics, as it allows for the manipulation of a function in terms of its Fourier transform, which can be used to solve many problems. 

In essence, the Bochner Identity states that a function f(x) can be expressed as the sum of its Fourier transform F(k) and its inverse Fourier transform F^-1(x). This means that the Fourier transform of a function can be used to calculate the original function. This can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as solving differential equations, or analyzing the behavior of a system. 

The Bochner Identity is an important concept in mathematics, and it can be used to solve many problems. By understanding how a function can be expressed as the sum of its Fourier transform and its inverse Fourier transform, mathematicians can gain a better understanding of the behavior of a system.
