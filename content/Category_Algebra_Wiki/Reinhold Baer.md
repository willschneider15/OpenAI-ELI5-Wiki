# Reinhold Baer

Reinhold Baer was a German mathematician who is known for his work on abstract algebra, particularly group theory. He is credited with introducing the concept of a "group" and defining the concept of a "group homomorphism." Group theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the structure of groups, which are collections of objects that have certain properties. A group homomorphism is a special type of mapping between two groups that preserves the structure of the groups. For example, a group homomorphism between two groups of numbers might preserve the operations of addition and multiplication. Baer's work has had a major impact on modern mathematics and is still studied today.
