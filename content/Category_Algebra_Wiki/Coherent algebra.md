# Coherent algebra

Coherent algebra is a type of algebra that uses a set of rules to help solve equations and problems. It involves manipulating equations and expressions to get the desired result. The main concept of coherent algebra is that equations should be written in a consistent and logical way. This means that the same operations should be used in the same order on both sides of the equation, and that the same symbols should be used for the same operations. This type of algebra is useful for solving complex equations, and it can help students better understand the underlying concepts behind the equations.
