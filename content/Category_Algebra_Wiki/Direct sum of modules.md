# Direct sum of modules

The Direct Sum of Modules is a concept used in abstract algebra to describe the sum of two or more modules. A module is a group of elements that satisfy certain conditions. The Direct Sum of Modules is a way of combining two or more modules into a single module. The Direct Sum of Modules is created by taking the elements of each module and adding them together. The result is a single module with elements that satisfy the same conditions as the original modules. The Direct Sum of Modules is an important tool in abstract algebra and can be used to solve various problems.
