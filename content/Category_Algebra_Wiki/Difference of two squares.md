# Difference of two squares

The difference of two squares is an algebraic expression that is used to factor polynomial equations. It is a type of factoring technique that is used to simplify equations by breaking them down into simpler expressions.

The difference of two squares is written as the expression `a^2 - b^2`. This expression can be broken down into two factors, `(a - b)(a + b)`. This can be used to factor polynomial equations with a degree of two.

For example, the equation `x^2 - 4x + 4` can be factored using the difference of two squares. The expression `x^2 - 4x + 4` can be written as `(x - 2)^2 - 4`. From here, the expression can be factored into `(x - 2)(x - 2) - 4`, which can then be rewritten as `(x - 2)(x - 2 - 4)`. This can then be simplified to `(x - 2)(x - 6)`.

The difference of two squares is a useful tool for factoring polynomial equations. It can be used to simplify equations and make them easier to solve.
