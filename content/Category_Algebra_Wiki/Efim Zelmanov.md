# Efim Zelmanov

Efim Zelmanov is a famous mathematician who is best known for his work on solving the famous "Kadison-Singer problem" in the field of operator algebras. This problem had been unsolved for decades and was considered one of the most difficult unsolved problems in mathematics. Zelmanov was able to solve the problem in 1994, and his solution earned him the Fields Medal, one of the highest honors in mathematics. Zelmanov's work has also been influential in other areas of mathematics, such as group theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. He is also known for his work on the "Zelmanov conjecture", which states that every infinite group is either finite or contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to the group of integers. Zelmanov's work has had a profound impact on mathematics, and he is highly respected in the field.
