# Marie Johanna Weiss

Marie Johanna Weiss is a popular concept in the field of psychology. It is based on the idea that a person's behavior is shaped by their environment. In other words, it suggests that people are influenced by the people and things around them. This concept is named after the German psychologist, Marie Johanna Weiss, who developed it in the early 20th century.

The idea behind Marie Johanna Weiss is that a person's behavior is determined by their environment. This includes the physical environment, such as the home they live in, as well as the social environment, such as the people they interact with. It suggests that people are more likely to act in certain ways if they are surrounded by positive influences. For example, if someone is surrounded by people who are kind and supportive, they are more likely to be kind and supportive themselves.

Marie Johanna Weiss' concept is still widely used today. It is used to help explain why people behave the way they do and why certain environments may be more beneficial to a person than others. It is also used to help guide people in creating positive environments that will help them reach their goals.
