# Vector-valued function

Vector-valued functions are functions that take an input and output a vector. A vector is a set of numbers that can be used to represent a direction or magnitude in space. For example, a vector-valued function can take an input of a number and output a vector with two components, such as (x, y). This vector can then be used to represent a point in a plane. Vector-valued functions are useful for describing the relationship between two or more variables that can be represented by vectors.
