# Daniel Hershkowitz

Daniel Hershkowitz is an Israeli politician and mathematician. He is best known for his work on the theory of algebraic curves and their applications to cryptography. He is also a former Minister of Science and Technology in the Israeli government.

Hershkowitz's work focuses on the mathematical properties of curves, and how these can be used to create secure cryptographic systems. He is particularly interested in the use of elliptic curves, which are curves that can be used to encrypt data. By understanding the mathematical properties of these curves, Hershkowitz has been able to develop new ways of encrypting data, making it more secure.

Hershkowitz's work is important because it helps protect people's data from malicious hackers. By understanding the mathematics behind cryptography, he has been able to develop new and more secure ways of encrypting data, making it harder for hackers to gain access to people's information.
