# Orthogonal transformation

Orthogonal transformation is a type of transformation used in mathematics and computer science. It is a transformation that preserves the angle between two vectors, meaning that after the transformation, the two vectors remain at right angles to each other. This is important because it means that the length of the vectors is not changed and the shape of the vectors is not distorted. Orthogonal transformations are used in many areas of mathematics, such as linear algebra and geometry, and in computer science, such as image processing and 3D graphics.
