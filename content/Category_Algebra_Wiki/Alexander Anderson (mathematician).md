# Alexander Anderson (mathematician)

Alexander Anderson was a mathematician who lived in the 19th century. He was known for his work on the theory of equations, which is the study of mathematical equations and how they can be solved.

Anderson was a professor at the University of Glasgow and wrote several books on mathematics. He developed a method of solving equations called the Anderson Method, which is still used today.

The Anderson Method is based on the idea that equations can be solved by finding the roots, which are the values of the variables that make the equation true. Anderson showed that equations can be solved more quickly and accurately by using the Anderson Method.

Anderson also worked on the theory of algebraic equations, which is the study of how equations can be solved when they involve more than one variable. He developed a technique called the Anderson-Meyer Theorem, which is still used today.

In summary, Alexander Anderson was a mathematician who developed the Anderson Method and the Anderson-Meyer Theorem. He was a professor at the University of Glasgow and wrote several books on mathematics, which are still used today.
