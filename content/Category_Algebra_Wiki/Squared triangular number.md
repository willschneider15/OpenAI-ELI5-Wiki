# Squared triangular number

A squared triangular number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of consecutive numbers, multiplied by itself. For example, 36 is a squared triangular number because it can be expressed as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and 15 x 15 = 225.

Squared triangular numbers are also known as square pyramidal numbers because they can be represented as a pyramid of number cubes. The base of the pyramid is a square with the side length equal to the consecutive numbers being added together. The number of layers in the pyramid is the same as the consecutive numbers being added together. 

Squared triangular numbers are important in mathematics because they can be used to represent the area of a triangle. For example, if a triangle has sides of length 3, 4, and 5, then its area is equal to the squared triangular number of 5, which is 15 x 15 = 225. 

In conclusion, squared triangular numbers are an important concept in mathematics because they can be used to represent the area of a triangle and can be represented as a pyramid of number cubes.
