# Quadratic formula

The Quadratic Formula is a mathematical equation used to solve a type of equation called a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is an equation with two variables (x and y) that can be written in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The Quadratic Formula is used to find the values of x that will solve the equation. 

The Quadratic Formula looks like this: x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a 

To use the Quadratic Formula, you need to know the values of a, b, and c. These values can be found by looking at the equation you are trying to solve. Once you have the values of a, b, and c, plug them into the formula and solve. 

The Quadratic Formula can be used to quickly solve quadratic equations and is an important tool for math students.
