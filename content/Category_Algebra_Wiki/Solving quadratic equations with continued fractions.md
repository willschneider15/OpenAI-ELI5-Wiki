# Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions

A continued fraction is an expression of a real number as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are both polynomials. Solving quadratic equations with continued fractions is a method of solving quadratic equations by expressing the equation as a continued fraction and then using algebraic manipulation to solve for the unknowns. This method is useful because it can be used to solve equations that have no rational solutions. The method is based on the fact that any quadratic equation can be expressed as a continued fraction, and that the coefficients of the equation can be determined from the continued fraction. The process of solving a quadratic equation with continued fractions involves first writing the equation in the form of a continued fraction, then manipulating the fraction to solve for the unknowns. This method can be used to solve equations with real and complex roots.
