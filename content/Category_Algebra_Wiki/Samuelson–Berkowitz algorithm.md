# Samuelson–Berkowitz algorithm

The Samuelson–Berkowitz algorithm is an algorithm used to solve games of perfect information. It was developed by economists Paul Samuelson and Jacob Berkowitz in the 1950s. The algorithm works by breaking down a game into smaller, simpler games, and then finding an optimal solution for each of those games. The algorithm then works backwards, combining the solutions to the simpler games to find an optimal solution for the entire game. This algorithm is often used to solve complex strategic decisions, such as those found in business and economics.
