# Lulu smoothing

Lulu smoothing is a way to make a graph or chart look smoother. It is used to reduce the amount of "noise" or random fluctuations in the data, making it easier to interpret. It works by taking the average of a certain number of data points, usually two or three, and replacing them with the average. This makes the graph look smoother and more consistent, and makes it easier to spot patterns or trends in the data. It is not always the best way to analyze data, but it can be helpful when you want to quickly get an overall idea of what the data is telling you.
