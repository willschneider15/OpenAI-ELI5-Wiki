# Idempotent matrix

Idempotent matrices are matrices that, when multiplied by themselves, result in the same matrix. For example, if you have a matrix A, and you multiply it by itself, the result will be the same matrix A. This is useful in many areas of mathematics and computer science, such as solving linear equations and matrix inverses. Idempotent matrices are also used in probability theory to calculate the probability of an event occurring multiple times. Idempotent matrices are like a special type of puzzle; they can help us solve problems that may seem difficult at first.
