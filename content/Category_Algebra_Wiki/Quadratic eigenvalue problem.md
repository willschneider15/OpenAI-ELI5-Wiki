# Quadratic eigenvalue problem

A quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) is a type of mathematical problem that involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. An eigenvalue is a scalar value associated with a particular vector in a matrix, while an eigenvector is a vector associated with a particular scalar value in a matrix. In a QEP, the matrix is quadratic, meaning that it contains both a linear and a quadratic component. The solution of a QEP involves solving a set of equations that are related to the linear and quadratic components of the matrix. The solution of the equations yields the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, which can then be used to solve other types of problems.
