# Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm

Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is a way to find the prime factors of a number. It works by breaking down the number into two parts, a prime number and the rest of the number. Then, the prime number is multiplied by the rest of the number to get the original number. This process is repeated until the rest of the number is 1, meaning that the prime number is the only factor of the original number. This process can be used to find the prime factors of any number.
