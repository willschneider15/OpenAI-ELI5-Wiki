# Kirchhoff's theorem

Kirchhoff's theorem states that the sum of currents entering a junction in a circuit must be equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction. This theorem is based on the law of conservation of charge, which states that the total amount of charge entering a junction must be equal to the total amount of charge leaving the junction. In other words, the amount of charge that enters a junction must be the same as the amount of charge that leaves the junction. This theorem is important for understanding how electrical circuits work and for designing electrical circuits.
