# Harish-Chandra isomorphism

Harish-Chandra isomorphism is a mathematical concept that relates two different mathematical objects. It states that the algebra of a Lie group is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra. This means that the two objects have the same structure and can be used interchangeably. This isomorphism is useful because it allows us to study Lie groups and Lie algebras together, which can help us understand the relationships between them. It is also useful for understanding the symmetries of a system, which can be used to solve complex problems.
