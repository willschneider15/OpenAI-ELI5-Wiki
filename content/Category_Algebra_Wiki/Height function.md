# Height function

The concept of a height function is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to a point in a two-dimensional space. It is typically used to represent the elevation of a point in a terrain, such as a mountain or a valley. The height of a point is calculated by measuring the vertical distance between the point and a reference datum, such as sea level. In other words, the height of a point is the vertical distance between the point and the reference datum. For example, if I am five feet tall, then my height is five feet above sea level.
