# Weitzenböck identity

Weitzenböck identity is a mathematical concept that relates the curvature of a surface to the divergence of its normal vector. It is named after the German mathematician Richard Weitzenböck and was first published in 1923.

The identity states that the divergence of the normal vector of a surface is equal to the sum of the Gaussian and mean curvatures of the surface. The Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures at a point, while the mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures.

Weitzenböck identity is useful in differential geometry, as it allows the curvature of a surface to be calculated from the normal vector. It also has applications in physics, such as general relativity, where it is used to calculate the curvature of spacetime.
