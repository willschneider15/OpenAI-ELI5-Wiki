# Algebraic expression

An **algebraic expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations. It is used to represent a mathematical relationship or a value. It is often used to describe the relationships between different variables and to solve equations. Algebraic expressions are used in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and calculus.

An algebraic expression can be written in two forms: a **literal form**, which is written as a single number, or a **symbolic form**, which is written as a combination of variables and operations. For example, the literal form of the expression `2 + 3` is `5`, while the symbolic form is `2 + 3`. 

Algebraic expressions are used to represent relationships between variables and to solve equations. For example, the expression `2x + 3` can be used to solve the equation `2x + 3 = 11`, which has the solution `x = 4`. 

Algebraic expressions can also be used to describe the relationships between two or more variables. For example, the expression `y = 2x + 3` describes the relationship between the variables `x` and `y`. The expression states that
