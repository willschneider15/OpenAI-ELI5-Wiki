# Choi's theorem on completely positive maps

Choi's theorem states that any completely positive map (CPM) between two matrix algebras can be represented by a matrix called a Choi matrix. A CPM is a map that takes a matrix and produces another matrix, while preserving the positivity of its elements. The Choi matrix is constructed by taking the tensor product of the original matrix and its transpose. This matrix can then be used to describe the CPM, giving a way to represent it mathematically. In short, Choi's theorem states that any CPM can be represented by a matrix called the Choi matrix.
