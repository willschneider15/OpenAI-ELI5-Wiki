# Nielsen–Schreier theorem

The Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that if a group G has a subgroup H, then the number of subgroups of H is equal to the number of subgroups of G. In other words, if you start with a group G, and then take a subgroup H of G, then the number of subgroups of H is the same as the number of subgroups of G.

This theorem has a lot of practical applications in mathematics, especially in group theory. For example, it can be used to prove that the number of subgroups of a finite group is always finite. It can also be used to prove that the number of subgroups of a cyclic group is always equal to the order of the group.
