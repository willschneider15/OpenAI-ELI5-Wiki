# Elementary algebra

Elementary algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with equations and the manipulation of variables. It helps us to solve problems by using symbols to represent numbers and operations. 

In elementary algebra, we use letters such as x and y to represent unknown numbers. We can then use equations to solve for the unknowns. For example, if we have the equation `2x + 3 = 5`, we can solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, giving us `2x = 2`. We can then divide both sides by 2, giving us `x = 1`. 

Elementary algebra can also be used to solve equations with more than one unknown. For example, if we have the equation `2x + 3y = 5`, we can solve for x and y by first solving for one of the variables and then substituting the answer into the equation. 

In summary, elementary algebra is a branch of mathematics that helps us to solve equations by representing unknown numbers with symbols and manipulating the equations to find the answers.
