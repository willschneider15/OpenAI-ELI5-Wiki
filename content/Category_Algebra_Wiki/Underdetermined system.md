# Underdetermined system

An **underdetermined system** is a system of equations with fewer equations than unknowns. This means that there are multiple solutions to the system, as the equations are not enough to determine a single unique solution. An example of an underdetermined system is a system of two equations with three unknowns. In this case, there are infinitely many solutions, as there is no way to determine the exact values of the three unknowns. Underdetermined systems can be solved using various techniques such as least-squares, regularization, and other optimization methods.
