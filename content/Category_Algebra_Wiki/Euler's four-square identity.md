# Euler's four-square identity

Euler's four-square identity is a mathematical equation that states that any positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four perfect squares. This means that if you have a number, you can break it down into four smaller numbers, each of which is a perfect square. For example, if you have the number 20, you can express it as 1² + 3² + 4² + 12². This equation was first discovered by the mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748. It's a useful tool for solving math problems because it allows us to break a number down into simpler parts.
