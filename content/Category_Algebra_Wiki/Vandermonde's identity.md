# Vandermonde's identity

Vandermonde's identity is a mathematical formula that helps us calculate the sum of a set of numbers when multiplied together. It is named after the French mathematician, Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde. 

The formula is written as: 

(x1 + x2 + x3 +...+ xn)^2 = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 +...+ xn^2 + 2x1x2 + 2x1x3 +...+ 2x(n-1)xn

This formula is useful for calculating the sum of a set of numbers when multiplied together. For example, if we want to calculate the sum of 1, 2, and 3 multiplied together, we can use Vandermonde's identity to get 1x2x3 = 6. 

Vandermonde's identity is a useful tool for simplifying complicated calculations. It can be used to quickly and easily calculate the sum of a set of numbers when multiplied together.
