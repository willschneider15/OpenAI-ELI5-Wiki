# Enumerator polynomial

Enumerator polynomials are mathematical equations that are used to count the number of objects in a given set. The equation is composed of variables representing the number of objects in the set and coefficients representing the number of ways in which the objects can be arranged. The equation is solved by substituting values for the variables and then solving for the coefficient. The coefficient is then used to determine the number of objects in the set. Enumerator polynomials can be used to count the number of permutations, combinations, and subsets of a set.
