# Higher-order operad

An operad is a mathematical structure that can be used to describe algebraic operations. A higher-order operad is an extension of an operad that allows for operations to be described across multiple levels. This means that, in addition to describing operations between two elements, higher-order operads can also describe operations between three or more elements. This can be used to describe the relationships between different objects or operations in a system. Higher-order operads are useful for describing complex systems with multiple levels of complexity.
