# Nth root

Nth root is a mathematical concept that involves finding the root of a number. It is used to find the original number from which a given number was derived. 

For example, if you have a number, say 8, and you want to find the square root of it, you would take the Nth root of 8, where N is 2. This would give you the original number, 4, from which 8 was derived. 

The same concept applies to any number and any root. For example, the cube root of 64 is 4, because 4 x 4 x 4 = 64. The Nth root of 64 is 4, where N is 3. 

In general, the Nth root of a number can be found by raising that number to the power of 1/N. For example, the 5th root of 32 would be 2, because 2 to the power of 1/5 is 32. 

Nth root is a useful concept in mathematics, as it allows us to find the original number from which a given number was derived.
