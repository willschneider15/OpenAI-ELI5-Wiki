# Szegő limit theorems

The Szegő limit theorems are a set of mathematical results that provide information about the behavior of certain sequences of numbers. Specifically, the theorems describe how the sequence behaves as its terms get closer and closer together. The theorems show that as the terms of a sequence approach a limit, the sum of the sequence approaches the same limit. This can be useful for estimating the value of a sum without having to calculate each term in the sequence.
