# Gelfandâ€“Kirillov dimension

Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is a way of measuring the size of an algebra. It's a way of counting how many "building blocks" an algebra is made of. To calculate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, you start by counting the number of elements in the algebra and then subtracting the number of relations that hold between the elements. The result is the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. This number can be used to compare different algebras and see which one is more complicated.
