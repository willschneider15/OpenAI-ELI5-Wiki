- **Why is it important?** Air pollution can cause health problems, such as asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease. It can also harm the environment, including plant and animal life. 
- **How can we control it?** There are several ways to control air pollution, including: 

  - **Regulations**: Governments create laws and regulations to limit the amount of pollution produced by factories, cars, and other sources. 
  - **Technology**: New technology, such as air filters and scrubbers, can remove pollutants before they are released into the air. 
  - **Alternatives**: Using alternative energy sources, such as wind or solar power, can reduce the amount of pollution produced by power plants.
