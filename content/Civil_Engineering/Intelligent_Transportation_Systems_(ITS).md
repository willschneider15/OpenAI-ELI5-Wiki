# Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are systems that use advanced technology to make transportation safer and more efficient. ITS uses different kinds of technology to collect data about transportation, such as traffic flow, incidents, and road conditions. The information is used to improve travel time, reduce congestion, reduce accidents, and protect the environment. ITS does this by coordinating and managing different types of transportation such as cars, trucks, public transit, and bicycles.

Here are some examples of ITS technologies:

- Traffic management systems
- Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS)
- Electronic toll collection
- Intelligent vehicle systems
- Transit signal priority (TSP)
- Connected vehicle technology

Overall, Intelligent Transportation Systems can help make transportation more dependable, efficient, and affordable; making it easier for people to get where they need to go safely and on time.
