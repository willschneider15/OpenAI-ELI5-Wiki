# Geomatics Engineering

Geomatics Engineering is a field that combines different science and technology to study and understand the earth and its surroundings. Think of it like taking a photo of the earth from above and being able to see all the details like buildings, mountains, coastlines and more.

Here are some of the main things Geomatics Engineers do:

* Collect data from the earth using tools like GPS, satellites, and cameras
* Create maps and models of the earth's surface and features
* Analyze and interpret the data to understand things like land use, urban planning and environmental impacts
* Use the data to plan and design projects like roads, buildings and other infrastructure

Geomatics Engineers use a lot of different tools and technologies to collect and analyze data including:

* GPS (Global Positioning Systems)
* GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
* Remote Sensing (using aerial or satellite imagery to gather data)
* Surveying (using tools to measure and map out the earth's surface)

Overall, Geomatics Engineering is all about using data to better understand the earth and make informed decisions about how to use it in a sustainable way.
