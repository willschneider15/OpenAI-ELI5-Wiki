# Estimating and Bidding

Estimating and bidding is about figuring out how much a construction project is going to cost before it starts, so that the people who are going to build it can make a fair price for their work.

* Estimating: 
  * Guessing how much time, materials, and other things will be needed for the project.
  * Evaluating all the sizes, measurements, and difficulties,the costs of resources, and what kinds of tools are needed for the job.
  * Using all the data gathered to determine the total cost to complete the project.

* Bidding: 
  * Submitting bids to an owner, contractor, or construction manager after estimating a project.
  * Based on the total estimated construction cost, the estimate will help to determine the actual value of the project and ensure contractors/ construction companies
  * submit their bids.

Overall, estimating and bidding helps prevent misunderstandings between property owners and their construction partners, specifying a budget from the outset, making sure all parties' expectations are realistic and set clear parameters for the construction work.
