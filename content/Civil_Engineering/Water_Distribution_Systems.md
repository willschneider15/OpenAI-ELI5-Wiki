# Water Distribution Systems

Water Distribution Systems are the underground pipes and structures that deliver clean water to households and businesses. Here's a simplified explanation for a 5-year-old:

* Do you like to drink water and take baths?
* Do you know where that water comes from?
* Water comes from big lakes or rivers, but it has to be cleaned before we can use it.
* Once the water is cleaned, it goes into pipes that are buried under the ground.
* These pipes are like straws that carry the water to our homes and businesses.
* Some pipes are bigger and some are smaller.
* The big pipes carry water to many different places, but the small pipes carry water to just one or two places.
* Sometimes the pipes break, and we have to fix them so that the water can keep flowing.
* Without water distribution systems, we wouldn't be able to have clean water whenever we need it!
