# Groundwater Engineering

Groundwater Engineering is a way to study, understand and control groundwater. Groundwater is the water that is found underground in the soil and rocks. Children as young as 5 will understand the concept when explained this way:

* Groundwater is like a secret underground river.
* Groundwater Engineering is what we use to understand how much water is in the river and how to access it.
* Sometimes we need to use wells to access groundwater, which is like digging a hole to reach the secret river.
* We use special tools to measure how much water is in the river and how fast it's flowing.
* With this information, we can make decisions on how to use the water.
* Sometimes we need to add more water to the river or change how the water is flowing.
* Groundwater Engineering helps us manage the water, so we always have enough for everyone who needs it.

Groundwater Engineering is important because:

* It helps us understand how much water is available for drinking, farming, and other important things.
* It helps us manage resources sustainably, so we don't use up all the water and harm the environment.
