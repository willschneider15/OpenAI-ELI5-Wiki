# Urban and Regional Planning

Urban and Regional Planning is like playing with blocks! Do you like playing with blocks to make a tower or a house? Just like that, Urban and Regional Planning is about creating cities and towns. Here's what it involves:

* Urban and Regional Planners make land-use plans to decide how land will be used.
* They determine what type of buildings can be built and where.
* They plan how people will move around the city or town. This includes cars, buses, and trains.
* They make sure the buildings are safe and can resist strong winds, or earthquakes.
* They make sure there is enough space, such as parks and playgrounds, for people to enjoy.
* They make sure there is enough water and clean air for people to drink and breathe.
* Urban and Regional Planning helps create a good quality of life for people who live in cities and towns, so they can be safe, healthy, happy, and comfortable. 

Remember, Urban and Regional Planning is like playing with blocks but itâ€™s more important!
