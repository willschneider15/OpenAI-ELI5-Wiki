# Engineering Ethics

Engineering ethics is all about being a good person and making good decisions when you design and build things. This is especially important when you are designing things that could hurt people or the environment if you don't do them right.

Here are a few important things to remember about engineering ethics:

- **Honesty**: Always tell the truth, even if it's hard to do.

- **Integrity**: Do the right thing, even if nobody is watching.

- **Responsibility**: Take responsibility for your actions and their outcomes.

- **Respect**: Treat others with respect, even if you don't agree with them.

- **Fairness**: Be fair and just, and treat people equally.

When you're an engineer, you have the power to make a big impact on the world. By making good decisions and following ethical principles, you can use your skills to make the world a better place for everyone.
