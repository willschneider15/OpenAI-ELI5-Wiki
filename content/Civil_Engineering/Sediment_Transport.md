# Sediment Transport

Sediment transport refers to the movement of rock and soil materials in water, such as rivers or oceans. Here's a quick rundown of the concept:

* Rocks and soil erode or break down over time, either naturally or through human activities like mining or construction.

* Water picks up these rock and soil particles and moves them along, where they can eventually settle in a new location.

* There are three types of sediment transport that occur in water: suspension, saltation, and traction.

* In suspension, the fine particles are carried along with the water flow without touching the bottom of the riverbed.

* Saltation is the transport of medium-sized particles which jump and bounce along the riverbed.

* Traction occurs when larger particles roll or slide along the riverbed.

* The rate of sediment transport can be influenced by various factors such as the velocity of water flow, the size and shape of the particles, and the slope of the river channel.

In Civil Engineering, understanding sediment transport is important for designing stable river channels, predicting the effects of erosion, and maintaining water quality in natural and man-made water systems.
