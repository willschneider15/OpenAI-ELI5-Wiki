# Retaining Structures

Retaining structures are like walls that are built to hold back soil or rock to create a level surface. These structures can be made from many different materials including wood, concrete or stone. They are used in many different applications, such as:

- Building roads and highways on hillsides or mountains
- Creating agricultural terraces on sloping land
- Building homes on sloping land
- Protecting against erosions along the coast

Retaining structures work by supporting the weight of the soil or rock behind them. They must be designed with careful consideration given to the soil, the weight of the material, water pressure or negative soil pressure that may be exerted on the structure.

Different types of retaining structures have different features, including:

- Gravity walls made of concrete, stone or brick, which relies on its weight to counteract soil pressure
- Cantilever walls, which are reinforced with steel rods that extend from the base of the structure to support the retaining wall.
- Sheet pile walls, made from steel or wood, which are inserted into the ground and help to hold the soil back. 

Retaining structures are important for creating safe and accessible spaces on slopes, while also preventing soil erosion and landslides. They must be designed and built with care to ensure they are safe and structurally sound.
