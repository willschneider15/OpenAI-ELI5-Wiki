# Transportation Systems

A transportation system is the way we move things like people and goods from one place to another. Imagine you need to go to your friend's house to play your favorite game. You can go in different ways:

* **Walking or biking**: you don't need any special machines, but it may take you a long time to get there.
* **Taking a car / bus / train**: these machines can make you go much faster and farther, but they need roads or tracks to be able to move.
* **Using an airplane**: this machine can make you go really far, even to other countries or continents. 

Transportation systems are important because they help us:

* Go to school, work, and other places;
* Get food, clothes, and other things we need;
* Send things to other people, like letters, gifts, or products to sell.

That is why civil engineers work to design and build transportation systems that are safe, efficient, and sustainable for everyone.
