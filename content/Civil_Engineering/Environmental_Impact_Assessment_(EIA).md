# Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)

**Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** is a process that helps us understand how a construction project or development will impact the environment. When we build new things, like houses, roads, or bridges, we can affect animals, plants, water, and air quality. 

EIA helps us to identify and reduce these negative impacts and promote positive ones. It takes into account a range of factors such as effects on:

- Biodiversity
- Water and air quality
- Soil health
- Noise pollution
- Landscape and visual quality
- Historic and cultural sites

There are 5 main steps to the EIA process:

1. Screening: When a proposal is first suggested, environmental authorities assess whether it needs an EIA.

2. Scoping: Authorities identify what potential impacts will be studied.

3. Impact Assessment: This step determines the potential impacts of the project.

4. Mitigation: Steps are taken to avoid, reduce, or manage negative impacts while enhancing any positive ones.

5. Monitoring: Authorities monitor the project to ensure it has followed the EIA and required measures. 

EIA helps us make our projects more sustainable and preserve our natural resources for generations to come!
