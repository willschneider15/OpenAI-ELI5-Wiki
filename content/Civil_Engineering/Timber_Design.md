# Timber Design

Timber design is just like playing with blocks!

* First, you need to choose the right blocks. 
* Different blocks have different strength and stiffness. 
* You need to choose the ones that can support the weight you want to put on them.
* After choosing the blocks, you need to put them together in a way that makes them strong enough to support the weight.

In timber design, it's the same:

* First, you choose the right type of timber. Different timber types have different properties that make them suitable for specific uses.
* You have to take into consideration the weight of the structure you're building.
* You have to calculate the stresses on the timber members and make sure they can handle the weight. 
* Then, you put the timber members together in a way that makes the structure strong enough to support the weight without collapsing.

It's important to follow the design specifications and building codes to make sure the structure is safe and reliable. With careful planning and execution, you can build beautiful and safe structures using timber!
