# Remote Sensing

Remote Sensing refers to the use of instruments to examine and collect information about objects from a distance. Below are some of the things you need to know about Remote Sensing.

* By using the instruments or scanners, information about an object can be collected and analyzed without coming into direct contact.
* The technique is developed to study the Earth's surface and allows people to create maps, observe weather patterns or detect changes in the landscape.
* Remote Sensing works on the basic principle of light detection and ranging or LIDAR.
* Cameras or other sensors are mounted on an aircraft, a satellite and/or drone that captures and records images and data of the terrain from above.
* The images and data are sent back to the earth and through image analysis the data can be interpreted and converted into useful information.
* Civil Engineers use remote sensing to design and monitor for new infrastructure projects such as bridges, highways or cities.

In summary, Remote Sensing uses cameras or other sensors to assess and gather information by taking measurements of the earth from above. Civil Engineers can use this data to plan and monitor projects that they are working on.
