# Offshore Structures

An offshore structure is a human-made structure built on the water expanse for several purposes such as transport, storage, and production. Offshore structures perform functions like oil and gas drilling, wind turbines to generate electricity, and wave power to generate electricity. Here is a breakdown of critical points to understand about offshore structures:

- Offshore structures are created specifically to withstand the extreme environment of the sea.
- They are constructed with unique materials, which are resistant to rust, erosion, and the elements at the location of the build.
- Offshore structures come in different types and shapes, such as fixed types such as Gravity Base Structure (GBS), Semi-Submersible Platform, and Floating Production Structure (FPS).
- Offshore structures can be located in shallow or deep water. The deeper the water, the more challenging the structure's design and construction.
- Construction of offshore structures can involve marine lifts, piling, jackets, and seabed preparation.
- It requires devices such as cranes, drill ships, mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs), and offshore support vessels to build and maintain structures offshore. 

Offshore structures are essential for the production of energy and the transport of goods. As a civil engineer, one needs knowledge in design, resource management, and project management of offshore structures.
