# Licensure and Certification

**Licensure** is like a driver's license for engineers. It's a way for the government to make sure that an engineer knows what they're doing and can be trusted to make safe decisions. 

* Engineers need a license to work on certain types of projects (like building bridges or designing electrical systems).
* To get a license, an engineer needs to pass a series of tests and meet certain education and experience requirements.
* Once an engineer has a license, they need to renew it regularly and make sure they follow certain rules and ethical standards.

**Certification** is like a gold star for engineers. It shows that an engineer has gone above and beyond to learn more and improve their skills. 

* Engineers can get certified in different specialties (like structural engineering or project management).
* To get certified, an engineer needs to pass an exam or meet certain education and experience requirements.
* Certification is optional, but it can help an engineer stand out in the job market and show that they're committed to their career. 

In summary, licensure ensures safety and competency while certification adds a level of expertise and professionalism to an engineer's career.
