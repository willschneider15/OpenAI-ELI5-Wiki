# Marine Engineering

Marine engineering is all about designing, building and repairing ships and other ocean-based structures. Here are some key concepts to help explain marine engineering to a 5-year-old:

* Marine engineering is like building big, floating houses that can travel on water.
* Engineers who specialize in marine engineering work to make sure these ships are safe and can withstand storms and waves.
* They use math and science to figure out how to make the ship strong, balanced and able to move through the water smoothly.
* Marine engineers also work on other ocean-based structures like docks, offshore platforms and underwater pipelines.
* They may even design devices that use the power of the ocean to generate energy, like wave energy converters or tidal turbines.

Overall, marine engineering is a fascinating field that mixes engineering and the ocean to create amazing structures that can help us explore, transport goods and travel the world.
