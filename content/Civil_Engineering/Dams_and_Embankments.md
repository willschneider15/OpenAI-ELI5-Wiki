# Dams and Embankments

### Concept of Dams and Embankments

- **Dams** are structures that are built across rivers and other water bodies to stop the flow of water and create a reservoir. Dams are built to provide water for irrigation, drinking, and household use. Dams also help in producing hydroelectric power.
- **Embankments** are similar structures to dams, but they are built on the banks of rivers or any other body of water. Embankments are used to prevent flooding of nearby areas, also known as flood control. 
- Both dams and embankments use materials like concrete, rocks, boulders, and soil for construction. The materials used in the construction of a dam depend on the type of dam that is being built, as there are different types of dams like gravity dams, arch dams, embankment dams, and more. 
- Similarly, the type of material used for embankment construction varies according to its location and design. The right selection of material, preparation of the foundation, proper design consideration and maintenance play an important role in the safe construction of dams and embankments.
- Dams and Embankments are examples of Civil Engineering projects that require a lot of planning, design, and construction to ensure that they are stable and safe for public use.
