# Deep Foundations

Deep foundations are like really, really big anchors that help to hold up really, really big buildings. They go deep down into the ground, like a straw that you stick into your drink. But instead of sucking up liquid, they are used to support weight.

So, what are deep foundations made of?

- It could be reinforced concrete, steel or timber.
- They are typically installed by drilling or driving them into the ground.

Why do we need deep foundations?

- Because sometimes the soil or rock near the surface is too weak to support a building all by itself.
- Or sometimes there is too much weight on top of the surface to be supported by shallow foundations.

Examples of deep foundations:

- Driven piles
- Drilled shafts
- Auger-cast piles
- Micropiles
- H-piles

Overall, deep foundations are important because they help keep buildings from sinking into the ground or collapsing under their own weight.
