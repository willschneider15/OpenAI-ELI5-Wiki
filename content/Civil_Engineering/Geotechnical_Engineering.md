# Geotechnical Engineering

Geotechnical Engineering is all about studying the behavior of soil and rocks on the Earth's surface.

* Geotechnical Engineering looks at how we can make use of soil and rocks to construct strong and durable buildings, roads, and foundations.

* It involves the investigation and analysis of the physical properties of soil, such as its strength, density, permeability, and so on.

* Geotechnical Engineers design structures that can withstand the forces of the Earth, such as earthquakes, landslides, and soil subsidence.

* They also identify the potential hazards in building on certain types of soil and rocks.

* In short, Geotechnical Engineers help us build the things we need to live and work safely on the Earth's surface.
