# Bridge Engineering

Bridge engineering is the science of building bridges to help people and vehicles safely get across rivers, canals, valleys, and other obstacles. Here's what you need to know:

* Bridges are strong and sturdy structures that are made up of many different parts.
* The design of a bridge is carefully planned to make sure it can support the weight of everything that will cross it, including cars, trucks, and even trains.
* Engineers use math and science to determine the size and shape of the bridge, as well as the materials that should be used to build it.
* Different types of bridges are used in different situations, based on factors such as the width of the obstacle and the amount of traffic that will cross the bridge.
* The construction of a bridge requires a team of workers who use heavy equipment and tools to carefully assemble the different pieces into a final product.
* After a bridge is built, it needs to be inspected regularly to ensure that it is safe for people to use.
