# Structural Engineering

Structural engineering is the process of designing structures, or building things that are strong and stable. It involves studying a lot of things that we can see around us like buildings, roads, bridges, and tunnels. Here are the key points to understand what Structural Engineering is all about:

* **Structural engineers** are the people who design structures and ensure they can hold the weight and withstand the forces of nature.

* They design structures that can be made with **concrete**, **steel**, **wood**, and other materials.

* Structural engineering is important because it allows us to build things that are safe and last for a long time.

* Structural engineers use a lot of **math** and **physics concepts** to design their structures so that they don't collapse.

* They also have to consider other factors like **budget**, **timeline**, and **materials availability** while designing a structure.

* Structural engineering is essential for all kinds of buildings like **homes**, **skyscrapers**, **hospitals**, **schools**, and more.

* Lastly, some of the most famous structural engineers include **Gustave Eiffel** (who designed the Eiffel Tower), and **Fazlur Rahman Khan** (who designed the Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower).
