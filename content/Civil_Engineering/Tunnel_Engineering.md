# Tunnel Engineering

CivilEngineers plan and design transportation systems that allow people, goods, and resources to travel from one place to another. These systems include roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and public transit networks. Tunnelsare underground passages that are excavated through soil or rock to create a pathway for transportation. Here's a breakdown of Tunnel Engineering, explained simply:

* Tunnel engineering is the process of designing, constructing, and maintaining tunnels that serve as safe passage for vehicular and human traffic underground. 

* Tunnel engineers work on many types of projects, including subways, highways, water supply systems, and more. 

* The design process of a tunnel involves the selection of the tunnel alignment, evaluation and selection of the method of tunnelling, and determination of the dimensions of the tunnel. 

* Engineers must ensure that the environment inside the tunnel is safe, which includes proper ventilation and lighting, emergency exits, and adequate drainage systems. 

* Tunnels can also be designed to withstand natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods. 

* Tunnel engineers must consider many factors such as the type of soil or rock, the water table, the potential for ground movement, and the location of any utilities. 

* In addition, tunnel engineers must ensure that the construction process itself does not have a negative impact on the environment, including analysis of site restoration, waste management, sustainability and energy efficiency.

 Now, you know the basics of tunnel engineering!
