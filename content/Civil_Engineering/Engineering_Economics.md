# Engineering Economics

Engineering Economics helps us understand how to make effective economic decisions about the projects and products we create as civil engineers. Here's a brief explanation that can help you understand the concept:

- Engineering Economics is like deciding how to spend your allowance. If you have $5 and you want to buy a toy that costs $3, you have to decide if it's worth it to spend that much money.
- In Civil Engineering, we use Engineering Economics to make decisions about the projects we create. For example, we might have to decide whether it's worth spending money to create a new bridge that will help people get from one place to another more easily.
- Part of Engineering Economics involves calculating costs and benefits. We have to think about how much it will cost to create the project and how much benefit it will provide. This helps us decide whether it's worth it.
- Another important part of Engineering Economics is considering things like "opportunity cost" â€“ in other words, what we might have to give up in order to complete the project. For example, if we build a new bridge, we might have to give up the opportunity to spend money on other projects.
- Overall, Engineering Economics helps us make smart, informed decisions and ensure that we are using our resources wisely in creating a better future for everyone.
