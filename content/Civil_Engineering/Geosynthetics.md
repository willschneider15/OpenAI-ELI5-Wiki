# Geosynthetics

Geosynthetics are materials used in construction and civil engineering that can help improve the properties of soil and make structures stronger. They are essentially fabrics that are made of synthetic materials like plastic, polymer and geotextile.

Geosynthetics can have different functions and are often used in combination with each other:
* **Geotextiles** can be used as a separation layer to prevent soil layers from mixing.
* **Geomembranes** can act as barriers to contain liquids and gases.
* **Geogrids** can reinforce soil and enhance its properties.
* **Geocomposites** can combine two or more geosynthetic materials for a specific function.

Some applications of geosynthetics include:
* Building roads, highways, railroads and other transportation infrastructure
* Constructing landfills to store waste
* Stabilizing slopes and retaining walls
* Protecting buildings and structures from ground movements

With their properties, geosynthetics add strength, durability, and reduce costs to the construction projects.
