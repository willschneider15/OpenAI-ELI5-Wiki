# Shoreline Management

Shoreline management is the process of taking care of the coast around us, to make sure that it stays healthy and safe for everyone. There are three main things that people do to manage the shoreline:

* **Protect the shore:** This means building things like sea walls or breakwaters to stop the waves from eroding away the beach or the land behind it.

* **Beach nourishment:** Sometimes the sand on the beach gets worn away by the waves. In this case, people can bring in new sand to replace it and keep the beach healthy.

* **Planning for the future:** As sea levels rise and storms become more powerful, it's important to have a plan for how to deal with these changes. Scientists and engineers work together to predict how the shoreline will change over time and what we can do to adapt.

By managing the shoreline in these ways, we can help prevent flooding, protect wildlife, and make sure that everyone can enjoy the coast for years to come.
