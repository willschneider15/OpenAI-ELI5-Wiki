# Solid Waste Management

## Solid Waste Management

* Solid waste management is a process to manage the waste generated by humans, industries and other activities.
* It includes the collection, transport, treatment, and disposal of solid waste.
* Solid waste can be organic (like food waste) or inorganic (like plastic).
* The goal of solid waste management is to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and the environment.
* The process involves sorting waste into recyclables and non-recyclables, reducing waste through composting and recycling and using alternatives like waste-to-energy plants.
* Proper solid waste management can help prevent pollution, protect public health and preserve natural resources. It can also minimize the spread of diseases and improve the overall cleanliness of the environment.
* Solid waste management is a shared responsibility between individuals, government authorities and industries to work together to create a sustainable and responsible approach for managing waste.
