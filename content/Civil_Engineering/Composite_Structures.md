# Composite Structures

A composite structure is like a superhero team that is stronger together than they are by themselves. A composite structure is made of two or more materials that work together to make the structure stronger, lighter, or more flexible than just one material alone. 

Here are some examples of composite structures:

- A baseball bat that is made of both wood and metal, making it stronger and more lightweight.
- A bridge that is made of both concrete and steel, making it stronger and more flexible.
- An airplane wing that is made of both carbon fiber and resin, making it lightweight and strong.

Composite structures are important because they can be designed to be:

- Stronger than traditional materials: By layering materials with different strengths and weaknesses, a composite structure can be made stronger than just one material alone.
- Lighter than traditional materials: By using lightweight materials in a composite, the final structure can be much lighter than if it was made with just one material.
- More flexible than traditional materials: Composites can be designed to be more flexible than traditional materials, which can be important in certain applications.

Overall, composite structures are like a puzzle where each piece brings something different to the table, resulting in a final product that is stronger and better than just one material alone.
