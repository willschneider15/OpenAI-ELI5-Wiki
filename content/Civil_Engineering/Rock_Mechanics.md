# Rock Mechanics

Rock Mechanics is the study of how rocks react when there is a change in the environment. When a force is applied to the rock, the rock either breaks or deforms or deforms and then breaks. Some of the important things civil engineers use rock mechanics for include

* safety
* excavation and tunneling
* mining operations
* designing foundations

To study rock mechanics, engineers use specialized equipment like testing machines, pressuremeters or lasers which help to measure the rock's strength and how it deforms. 

By analyzing how the rocks behave in certain conditions, engineers can make predictions about how they will behave in the future. This enables them to make important decisions about how to design structures in order to ensure their safety, as well as plan for any environmental impacts.
