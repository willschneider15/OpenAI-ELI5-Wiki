# Sanitary Sewer Systems

Sanitary sewer systems are like a magic machine that takes all the dirty water from our homes and magically makes it disappear!

Here's a little more about how it works:
* The pipes that are used in the Sanitary Sewer System are hidden underground.
* Every time we use our toilet, kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower, the dirty water goes through pipes and pipes, Until it all ends up in one big pipe called the sewer pipe.
* The sewer pipe carries all the dirty water to a wastewater treatment plant, where the magic happens!
* Engineers and workers remove all the dirt, debris, and even tiny particles from the water.
* They make sure the water is clean and safe to release into nearby rivers or oceans.
* After this process, the clean water can also be used for things like irrigating fields or watering gardens.

That's how easy it is to understand about Sanitary Sewer Systems!
