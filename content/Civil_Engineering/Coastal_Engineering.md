# Coastal Engineering

Coastal Engineering is the study of the processes affecting the coastal areas, including shorelines, beaches, dunes, and estuaries. This field aims to understand the interaction between the ocean and land, and to design and implement solutions to protect the land from the forces of the ocean. 

Some key concepts of Coastal Engineering include:

- **Coastal erosion**: the process of the coastal land being worn away by waves, currents, and other natural forces. This can lead to loss of property and habitat.
- **Sediment transport**: the movement of sand, rocks, and other materials along the coast. Sediment transport can impact the shape of the coastline and the stability of structures built near the water.
- **Wave modeling**: the study of how waves behave and interact with the coastline. Wave modeling can help predict and mitigate the effects of storms and other extreme weather events.
- **Structural design**: the development of structures such as seawalls, breakwaters, and jetties to protect coastal areas from erosion and other hazards.

Coastal Engineering is an important field that helps protect our coastlines and the communities located near them.
