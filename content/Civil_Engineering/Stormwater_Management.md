# Stormwater Management

Stormwater management is about taking care of the water that comes from rain and melting snow. It is important because too much water can damage buildings or make flooding. Here are some important things to know about stormwater management:

- **Stormwater runoff**: When it rains, the water goes wherever it can: into the soil, rivers or lakes. The excess of this water is called stormwater runoff.

- **Storm drains**: The water that runs down our streets goes into something called a storm drain. That water is then carried away to a canal, river, or an ocean.

- **Stormwater management**: This is the process of collecting and storing rainwater so it can be used later, and so it does not cause problems like floods. This can include building rain gardens, storing water in tanks or ponds, or creating permeable surfaces.

- **Permeable surfaces**: Concrete and asphalt don't let water through, but permeable surfaces like gravel and grass do. Using more of these materials can help reduce the amount of rainwater that flows into the storm drain system.

- **Green infrastructure**: This refers to ways of managing stormwater that use natural systems to absorb and filter water. This can include using trees, plants, and soil, which can help absorb water and reduce pollution.

In summary, managing stormwater is important to prevent flooding and water damage, and can be done through things like collecting rainwater, using permeable surfaces, and incorporating green infrastructure.
