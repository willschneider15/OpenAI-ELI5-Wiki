# Wave Mechanics

Wave Mechanics is the study of how waves behave and travel through different materials.

* Waves are a type of energy that travels through space, transferring energy from one point to another without displacing matter permanently.
* Waves can be found in different forms, including light waves, sound waves, ocean waves, earthquake waves, and many others.
* Waves can be described and studied by their frequency or wavelength, which determine their properties such as speed, direction, and intensity.
* The most common types of waves include mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. Mechanical waves require a medium to move through, while electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum or empty space.
* Wave Mechanics helps engineers understand and predict how waves interact with different materials, including buildings, bridges, and other structures.
* Understanding wave mechanics can also help engineers design materials that can absorb, reflect or transmit different types of waves, such as sound waves or electromagnetic waves.
