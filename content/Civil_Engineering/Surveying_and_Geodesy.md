# Surveying and Geodesy

Surveying is finding out where things are on the earth. It helps engineers understand where they need to build new things or how to modify the current ones. It gives us the ability to measure land and water areas, and to design and construct buildings and infrastructure like bridges or tunnels. Surveying is used to accomplish the following tasks:

* To identify and locate property lines
* To measure distances, angles, and elevations between points on the earth's surface
* To make maps that include topographic features like mountains, valleys, and rivers
* To determine the position of objects and structures on or below the ground
* To create plans, drawings, and digital models of the built environment.

Geodesy is related to surveying but focuses more on understanding the shape and size of the Earth. It helps us measure and map the Earth's surface and gravity field, and understand how it changes over time. Geodesy is used to accomplish the following tasks:

* To measure the size and shape of the Earth, taking into account factors such as the deviation from a perfect sphere due to the Earth's rotation and other forces
* To measure and track movements in the Earth's crust, including plate tectonics and earthquakes
* To monitor changes in sea level and climate over time
* To source and present accurate data for satellite positioning and navigation systems.

Together, surveying and geodesy provide essential tools for engineers to understand the earth's physical attributes and to design sustainable and effective infrastructural projects.
