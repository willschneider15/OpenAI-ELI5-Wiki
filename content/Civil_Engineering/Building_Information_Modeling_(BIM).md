# Building Information Modeling (BIM)

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is like creating a virtual copy of a building before it's even built.

* BIM uses special software to make 3D models of buildings, just like how a video game uses 3D graphics to create a game world.
* This 3D model has everything you need to know about the building, like where the walls go, how much space is inside, and where the windows are.
* BIM also has information about how the building will be constructed, like how much concrete is needed and where the electrical wires go.
* When you make changes to the BIM model, it automatically updates everything else, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to change something.
* BIM is really helpful because it can catch mistakes before they happen, saving time and money. If you build something in the BIM model and it doesn't work, you can fix it before you start building the real thing.
* Architects, engineers, and construction workers all use BIM to work together and make sure the building is perfect.
