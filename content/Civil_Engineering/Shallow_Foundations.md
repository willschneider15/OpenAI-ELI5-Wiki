# Shallow Foundations

Shallow Foundations are like the feet of a building or structure. They are the part of the foundation that is close to the surface of the ground. 

- They are used when the soil is strong and close to the surface. 
- They are not used when the soil is weak and deep because they will not be able to support the weight of the structure. 
- They are also not used when the structure is very tall because the weight would be too much for the soil to handle. 
- Shallow Foundations come in many shapes and sizes. Some common types include spread footings, slab-on-grade, and mat foundations. 
- Spread footings are like the legs of a table, they spread out the weight of the structure so that it is evenly distributed over a larger area. 
- A slab-on-grade is a flat, horizontal foundation used for things like garages or workshops. 
- Mat Foundations are used when there are lots of different loads and different types of soil. They spread the weight of the structure over a larger area, making it more stable.
