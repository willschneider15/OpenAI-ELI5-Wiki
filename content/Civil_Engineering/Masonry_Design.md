# Masonry Design

Masonry design is like building with toy bricks, but for big buildings. It involves using special blocks made of materials like concrete or clay to make walls and structures that can hold up the weight of the building. 

Here are some basic concepts:

- **Load-bearing** walls are walls that support the weight of the building above them. They need to be strong enough to hold everything up without collapsing. 
- **Non-load-bearing** walls are walls that don't have to support weight. They can be made of different materials and can be used to divide up spaces.
- **Reinforcing** steel bars are added to the masonry walls to make them stronger. They need to be placed in the right spots to help support the weight of the building.
- **Seismic** design is important for areas prone to earthquakes. Special reinforcements and design techniques are used to prevent the building from collapsing during an earthquake.
- **Compression** is the force that pushes down on the masonry blocks. It is important to make sure the blocks can handle this force.
- **Tension** is the force that pulls on the masonry blocks. Reinforcing steel bars can help withstand this force. 

Masonry design is important for creating buildings that are safe, strong and functional for people to live or work in.
