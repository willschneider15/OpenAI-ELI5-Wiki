# Contracts and Specifications

Contracts are like making an agreement or promise to do something, like when parents tell their kids they can have ice cream if they clean their room.

* A contract is an agreement between two or more people about something that needs to be done.
* Contracts can be written or spoken.
* In civil engineering, contracts are necessary for big projects to make sure everyone knows what needs to be done and who is responsible for what.
* Contracts have details about the different parts of the project, how much money is involved and when the work would be completed.
* The contract protects everyone's interests and makes sure that everyone is on the same page.
* The specifications in a contract are like the recipe or the instructions for the project. They describe what has to be done in every step of the process.
* The specifications detail materials, measurements, testing methods and all other details of the project to make sure the final project meets quality standards.
* Contracts and specifications are important to make the project successful and protect everyone involved.
