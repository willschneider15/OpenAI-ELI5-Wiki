# Traffic Engineering

Traffic engineering is about improving the way people and vehicles move around streets, roads, and highways. Traffic engineers consider things like speed limits, lane markings, traffic signals, and signs to make sure traffic flows smoothly and people are safe. They also study traffic patterns, vehicles' speed and volume, accidents and analyze data to determine improvements.

### Here are some ways traffic engineers improve the flow of traffic:

- Designing streets and highways to minimize traffic congestion, queues, and delays
- Controlling the time that traffic signals change to match expected traffic volumes
- Installing safety barriers, pedestrian crossings, sidewalks and bike lanes to improve safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists

In other words, traffic engineers make travel more convenient and safe for everyone who uses our streets and highways.
