# Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation

Resilience means that something can bounce back or recover from a perturbation, such as a natural disaster, while still maintaining its basic purpose or function. In the context of civil engineering, resilience refers to designing and constructing infrastructure, like roads or buildings, to withstand extreme weather events brought about by climate change.

Climate change adaptation is a process where we build resilience within our communities and infrastructures to prevent or minimize damages brought about by climate change. It is the process of taking actions that lessen the negative impacts of climate change. Adaptation measures can range from infrastructure design to policy changes, such as:

- Implementing sustainable urban drainage systems to cope with increased rainfall
- Incorporating green infrastructure, such as planting trees or green roofs, to reduce the urban heat island effect
- Elevating buildings and other infrastructure to reduce the risk of flooding
- Developing evacuation procedures or constructing safe shelters to protect communities from severe weather events.

Climate change adaptation is important because it can save lives, prevent destruction, and ensure the continued functioning of our built environment in the face of changing climate patterns.
