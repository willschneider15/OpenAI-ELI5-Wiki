# Wastewater Treatment

Wastewater is the water that we use in our homes, schools, and workplaces for various purposes such as bathing, flushing toilets, washing dishes, and laundry. Since this water contains dirt, soap, food scraps, and other harmful chemicals, it can't be released back into the environment without proper treatment. Therefore, we need to treat wastewater before releasing it into the environment. This process is known as Wastewater Treatment. Following are the steps involved in the Wastewater Treatment process:

- Primary Treatment: During this step, large debris and solids are removed from wastewater with the help of screens and grit chambers. In this way, wastage like rags, sticks, and stones are removed.

- Secondary Treatment: In this step, biodegradable organic matter is removed from the wastewater by using biological agents, like bacteria and other microorganisms, that break down the organic matter to harmless substances. This is often done in large tanks known as activated sludge systems.

- Tertiary Treatment: This is the final step in which any remaining contaminants are removed from the water via additional filtration methods, like UV light or chlorination, before water can be released into the environment.

After proper treatment, the clean water is released back into the environment, whereas sludge, a solid waste material separated during the treatment process, can be further treated or disposed of in landfills or used for agricultural purposes.
