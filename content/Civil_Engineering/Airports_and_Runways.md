# Airports and Runways

Airports are places where planes take off and land. They have large runways where planes can land and take off safely. Here's a simple explanation you might find helpful:

* Airports are like a big playground for airplanes.
* Runways are long, flat, and wide strips of road for airplanes to take off and land.
* They need to be long because airplanes need a lot of space to run and get up to speed before they can take off.
* It's important for runways to be flat and smooth because airplanes need a smooth surface to take off and land safely.
* Runways also have markings that help the pilots know where they are on the runway and when they need to take off or turn.
* Airports have towers where air traffic controllers work. They make sure that planes take off and land safely by communicating with the pilots and telling them when it's safe to do so.

That's the basic idea of what airports and runways are all about. There's a lot more to it, but that's a good start!
