# Wetlands and Estuarine Systems

Wetlands are like sponges for the earth. They are areas where the ground is always wet or covered with water. They are important because they help to filter pollutants and provide homes for animals.

Estuarine systems are areas where fresh water meets salt water. These areas are always changing because the water levels rise and fall with the tides. They are important because they provide nurseries for fish and other animals. They also help to filter pollutants and provide protection from storms.

Some fun facts about wetlands and estuaries:

- Wetlands cover about 6% of the earth's surface.
- There are three types of wetlands: bogs, swamps, and marshes.
- Estuaries are sometimes called nursery areas because many species of fish lay their eggs there.
- Some animals that live in wetlands include otters, beavers, and muskrats.
- Some animals that live in estuaries include blue crabs, oysters, and shrimp.

Overall, wetlands and estuarine systems are important parts of our environment that help to keep our planet healthy.
