# Soil Stabilization

Soil stabilization is like giving the soil extra strength and durability, so it doesnâ€™t crumble away when buildings or roads are built on top of it. 

* Essentially, it's a process of improving soil performance for construction purposes. 
* This is typically done by adding some sort of material to the soil to enhance its properties. 
* Soil stabilization can be accomplished with a variety of materials including cement, fly ash, lime, and polymer additives. 
* When these materials mix with the soil, they fill in the tiny spaces between soil particles, creating a stronger composition. 
* Stabilization can also help prevent soil erosion, shrinkage, and swelling caused by moisture. 
*Different methods of stabilization are used based on the type of soil and the intended use of the area, some of them are mechanical, chemical, thermal or electrical methods. 

Soil stabilization is a crucial technique that helps ensure the safety and longevity of human infrastructure.
