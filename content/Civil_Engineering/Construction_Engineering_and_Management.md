* CEM involves coordinating all aspects of a construction project, from the initial planning stages to the final completion of the project.
* CEM professionals need to understand a wide range of skills, including engineering principles, project management, and economics.
* The goal of CEM is to ensure that construction projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.
* CEM professionals work closely with architects, contractors, and other stakeholders to ensure that all aspects of the construction project are managed effectively.
* Some of the key responsibilities of CEM include site selection, project planning and scheduling, budgeting and cost control, procurement, quality control, and risk management.

In summary, Construction Engineering and Management is an important part of Civil Engineering that focuses on managing construction projects from start to finish. It involves coordinating all aspects of the project to ensure that it is completed to a high standard, within budget, and on time.
