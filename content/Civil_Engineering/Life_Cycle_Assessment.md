# Life Cycle Assessment

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is like looking at the entire life of a product or process from birth to retirement. It's a way to understand not just what a thing is like today, but also how it got to be that way and what it will become in the future.

* LCA considers not only the resources used in creating the product or process, but also the environmental and social impacts throughout its life
* It helps to identify any negative impacts and provides a way to improve them, reducing the overall impact on the environment
* The idea is to use resources more efficiently, reduce waste, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
* LCA can be used to compare different products or processes and help organizations make informed decisions about which option is most sustainable
* Risks associated with the product can be identified and addressed
* It can be used to identify areas for improvement in the design, production, use or disposal of the product, leading to better product design and better decision making
* LCA is an internationally accredited method, used to assess the environmental performance of products, technologies and services.
 
LCA is important because it helps us to identify the most sustainable solution for our products and processes, ultimately leading to a better future for the environment and for us.
