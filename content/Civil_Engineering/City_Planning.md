# City Planning

City planning is like playing a game of "The Sims" but with real life! Just like you build and design your virtual city, city planners do the same thing in real life. Here are the key things to remember:

- **Designing for the people**: City planning is all about making a city work for the people who live there. It's important to know what people need and want, and design a city that meets those needs.
- **Long-term planning**: When city planners design a city, they're thinking about the future. They want to make sure that the city will continue to work well even as it grows and changes.
- **Infrastructures**: City planners design infrastructure, like roads, bridges, and sewers, to make sure people can get around and have access to everything they need in the city.
- **Sustainability**: City planners also try to design cities that are environmentally sustainable. They consider things like pollution, energy use, and waste management in their designs.
- **Collaboration**: City planning is a team effort. City planners work with other professionals, like architects, engineers, and politicians, to design and build a city that works for everyone.

Overall, city planning is about designing and building cities that work well for the people who live there, both in the present and in the future.
