# Coastal Protection

Coastal protection is the idea of building structures to protect the coast from erosion and flooding. Some areas are more prone to erosion and flooding than others. Building structures to protect those areas is crucial to guard against the impacts of natural disasters. 

Here are some things to know about coastal protection:

- Coastal areas can have many different kinds of structures to protect them, including seawalls, breakwaters, and dikes. 
- Seawalls are walls built along the coast to block waves and stop erosion. 
- Breakwaters are barriers built offshore to reduce wave energy and protect the coast. 
- Dikes are walls or embankments built to keep water from flooding coastal areas. 
- Coastal protection is important because it can help prevent damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure in the event of a storm or tidal surge. 
- It can also help protect important natural habitats along the coast. 

Coastal protection is an essential aspect of civil engineering, especially because climate change is creating a more pressing need for protection measures.
