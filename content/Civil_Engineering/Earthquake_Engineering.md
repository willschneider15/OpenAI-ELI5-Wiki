Earthquake Engineering is about keeping people safe during earthquakes.

* An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth's surface.
* Earthquake Engineering is about making structures that are safe during an earthquake.
* This type of engineering takes into account how the ground shakes during an earthquake and how that affects buildings and people.
* Engineers use math and physics to design buildings and structures that can withstand the shaking caused by an earthquake.
* They also design the systems that keep buildings safe, such as sprinklers and fire alarms.
* Earthquake Engineering is important because it helps keep people and their belongings safe during a natural disaster.
* It is also important because it helps us learn how to prevent earthquake damage in the future.
