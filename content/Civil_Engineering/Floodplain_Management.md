# Floodplain Management

Floodplain management is planning how to deal with water when it rain a lot, so it doesn't hurt people's homes, their things, or people themselves. Here's how it works:

* When rain falls, it goes into little rivers or bigger streams.
* Sometimes there is too much rain or the rivers and streams are blocked, and the water overflows into the land nearby- this is called flooding.
* Floodplain is the area of land that's close to the rivers and streams that can flood. 
* Floodplain management is about stopping people from building houses or businesses in places that will flood, or helping them build in ways that won't get damaged by the water.
* It's also about making sure that the water goes to safe places that won't hurt people instead of just flooding their homes.
* Civil engineers play an important role in implementing floodplain management plans that can save people's lives, homes, and valuable things when there is an excess of rain.
