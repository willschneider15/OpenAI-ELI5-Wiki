# Water Resources Engineering

Water resources engineering teaches us how to manage water in a way that is sustainable for our environment, as well as useful for us, as human beings.

* Freshwater is a finite resource, which means there's only so much of it.
* We rely on freshwater for many things, like drinking, cleaning, and growing food.
* Water resources engineering helps us find ways to make sure we always have enough freshwater to meet these needs.
* It also helps us solve problems related to water, like natural disasters (such as floods), droughts, and pollution.
* Water resources engineering involves studying things like distribution systems (how we get water from one place to another), hydrology (the science of water), and water treatment (making sure water is clean).
* Engineers working in this field design solutions to problems related to water management, treatment and distribution.
* They also work to find sustainable ways to use water in a way that doesn't harm the environment.
* Ultimately, water resources engineering is all about finding ways to protect this precious resource so that it can serve us well, now and into the future.
