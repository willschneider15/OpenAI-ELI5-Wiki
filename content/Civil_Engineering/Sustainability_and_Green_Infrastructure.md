# Sustainability and Green Infrastructure

Sustainability is about being able to do things without damaging the environment so that people can continue to do those things in the future. It’s like having a toy and being able to use it for a long time as long as you take care of it. Here are some things that we do to make sure that what we build is sustainable:

* We use materials that won’t run out or take a long time to grow back.
* We make sure that what we build isn’t going to hurt the environment or people.
* We use renewable energy, like wind or solar power, instead of burning fossil fuels that cause pollution.

Green Infrastructure is like giving the environment a hug. We use plants and other natural things to help our buildings and cities fit into the environment. Here are some things that we use Green Infrastructure for:

* We plant trees and grass to make the air cleaner and the water fresher.
* We build filters to catch stormwater so that it doesn’t flood and pollute rivers and lakes.
* We try to make our buildings and cities more friendly to animals so that they can keep living there too.
