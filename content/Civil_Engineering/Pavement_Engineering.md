# Pavement Engineering

Pavement engineering deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of roads, highways, airport runways, and parking lots. Here are some explanations for a 5-year-old child:

- Pavements are the surfaces we walk and drive on.
- Just like we need to choose the right clothes for different weather, we need to choose the right materials and thickness for pavements depending on things like how many cars will use it and how cold or hot it gets.
- Engineers make sure the pavement won't break or get bumpy too quickly by doing tests on the ground and the materials.
- When a pavement gets old, it needs to be fixed or replaced. Engineers decide if it's better to fix one small part or make a whole new pavement.
- Pavement engineering helps everyone travel safely and comfortably without damaging the vehicles or the environment.

In summary, pavement engineering involves designing, constructing, and maintaining surfaces on various transportation infrastructure such as roads, highways, and parking lots, by selecting appropriate materials, testing their strength, and repairing or replacing those surfaces when necessary.
