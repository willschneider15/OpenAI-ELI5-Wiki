# Water Treatment

In very simple terms, water treatment means cleaning water before we can drink or use it safely. Here's how it works:

1. Collection: Water is collected from natural sources like rivers or groundwater.

2. Screening: Large debris, such as leaves or sticks, are removed from the water.

3. Coagulation and Flocculation: Chemicals are added to the water to attract dirt particles and make them stick together to form a larger mass.

4. Sedimentation: The water is allowed to sit and the heavier particles sink to the bottom.

5. Filtration: Water passes through a series of filters, such as sand or charcoal, to remove smaller particles.

6. Disinfection: Chemicals like chlorine are added to kill any remaining bacteria or viruses.

7. Storage: The water is stored in clean tanks or reservoirs until it is ready to be distributed.

Overall, the goal is to remove contaminants and make the water safe for consumption and other uses.
