# Land Use and Zoning

Land use is how people use different parts of land, like building houses, growing food, and parks. Zoning is when cities or towns make rules about how different areas of land can be used. Cities might say, "this area is only for stores" or "this area is only for homes." Different zones can have different rules about how big buildings can be, how many people can live there, and how much noise they can make.

Why is zoning important?

* It helps to keep neighborhoods organized and makes it easier for people to find what they need.
* It helps to keep people safe by keeping things like factories away from homes.
* It can help to protect natural resources by only allowing certain types of development in different areas.
* It helps to manage population growth by planning how much land should be used for different purposes.
