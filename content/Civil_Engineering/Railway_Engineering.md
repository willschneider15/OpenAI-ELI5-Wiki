# Railway Engineering

Railway engineering is a part of civil engineering that involves designing, building, and maintaining railways or train tracks that allow trains to run smoothly and safely. Here are five things to know about railway engineering:

- Trains need tracks that are straight and level to prevent accidents, so railway engineers use advanced design software to create tracks that are safe for trains to run on.
- Railway engineers must consider factors like weather, temperature, and humidity when designing and building tracks, because these can all affect how the tracks perform over time.
- Railway engineers also consider how the trains will interact with the tracks. They design tracks to allow trains to travel at different speeds, make turns, and change tracks without slowing down or stopping.
- In addition to designing and building tracks, railway engineers also design the various components of a train system, like bridges, tunnels, and stations.
- Finally, railway engineers work closely with maintenance teams to make sure that the tracks and other components of the train system are properly maintained and repaired over time to keep everything running safely and smoothly.
