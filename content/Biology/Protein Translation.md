# Protein Translation

Protein Translation is the process by which cells make proteins. Proteins are an essential part of the body, they help maintain cells, fight off diseases and form new cells. The process of Protein Translation can be broken down into three main steps:

*  **Initiation:** The first step is the initiation phase. Specialized proteins attach themselves to the beginning of the RNA sequence. This helps to identify where the new protein chain will be started.

*  **Elongation:** The next step is elongation. This is the process by which amino acids are added one-by-one in a specific order to create a new protein chain. This is done through the use of transfer RNA molecules which "read" the RNA sequence and supplies one amino acid at a time.

*  **Termination:** Finally, the third step is the termination phase. This occurs when the ribosomes reach the end of the RNA sequence, and the new protein molecule is complete. At this point, the protein chain releases from the ribosome and it can then be used throughout the body.

In summary, Protein Translation is a complex process that involves multiple steps. However, it is a critical process that allows the body to create the proteins that it needs to function properly.
