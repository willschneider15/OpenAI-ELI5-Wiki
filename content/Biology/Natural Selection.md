# Natural Selection

**Natural Selection**

Natural selection is a process where different organisms have different traits and those with traits that help them better survive in their environment will be more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, these traits become more common in the population.

* Natural Selection is like a game of "Survival of the Fittest."
* Imagine if you had a bunch of animals, but only those who were good at finding food and avoiding predators survived.
* These successful animals would be able to pass on their genes to their offspring, increasing the frequency of those traits in the population.
* Eventually, the population would have more individuals with attributes for survival. 
* Natural Selection is very important because it allows species to adapt to changes in their environment over time.
* Natural Selection can lead to the development of new species because over time there can be enough genetic divergence which can lead to the development of new species.
