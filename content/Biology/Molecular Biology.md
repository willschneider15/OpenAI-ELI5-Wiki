# Molecular Biology

Molecular Biology is the study of the tiny building blocks that make up living things.

These tiny building blocks are called molecules. Molecules are made up of even tinier parts called atoms.

In Molecular Biology, scientists learn about the different molecules that living things are made of. They also learn about how those molecules work together to keep living things alive.

Some important molecules that scientists study in Molecular Biology include:

- DNA: This is the molecule that carries the instructions for making new living things. It's like a recipe book for life!
- RNA: This is a molecule that helps make proteins, which are important for many things, including helping to keep our bodies healthy.
- Proteins: These molecules do many different things, like helping to build and repair our bodies, and making sure our cells can communicate with each other.

Molecular Biology is important because it helps us understand how living things work. By studying molecules, scientists can learn how to treat diseases, create new medicines, and even genetically modify organisms to make them better suited for certain tasks.
