# DNA Repair

DNA Repair is like fixing a broken toy, but instead of a toy it's our body's instruction manual. DNA is the code that tells our body how to build and maintain itself. The body is constantly exposed to things that can damage this code like the sun, chemicals, or even mistakes that occur while replicating the DNA. DNA Repair is the process in which specialized proteins in our cells fix these damages to prevent disease and mutations. 

Here's how it works: 

- When damage occurs, cells stop dividing and the cell cycle stops.
- Specialized proteins like endonucleases and exonucleases identify the damaged part of the DNA molecule.
- Then, the damaged segment of the DNA is either removed or repaired. 
- Once the damage has been repaired, cells can continue to divide and function normally.

There are different types of DNA damage that require different repair mechanisms. The three main types of DNA Repair include:

- Base Excision Repair (BER) – repairs damage due to individual base modifications.
- Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) – repairs damage caused by UV radiation or chemicals.
- Mismatch Repair (MMR) – repairs mistakes that occur during DNA replication.

In summary, DNA Repair is how our body fixes its instruction manual to prevent disease and mutations.
