# Gas Exchange

Gas exchange is the process of getting oxygen from the air and getting rid of carbon dioxide in the blood. This process happens in the lungs and is essential for all living beings that breathe air. Here's how it happens:

* You breathe air in through your nose and mouth
* The air travels down a tube called the trachea and into your lungs
* The lungs have tiny air sacs called alveoli where the gas exchange happens 
* Oxygen from the air moves into your bloodstream through the walls of the alveoli and into tiny blood vessels called capillaries
* At the same time, carbon dioxide from the blood moves into the alveoli
* When you exhale, the carbon dioxide is breathed out of your body

That's basically what gas exchange is! It's an important process that allows your body to get the oxygen it needs to function properly.
