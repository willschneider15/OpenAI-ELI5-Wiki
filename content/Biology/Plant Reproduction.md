# Plant Reproduction

Plant reproduction is the process by which plants make new plants.

There are two main types of plant reproduction: 

* **Asexual reproduction:** A plant produces offspring that are exactly like itself, without the need for fertilization by another plant. Some examples of asexual reproduction are:

   * **Vegetative reproduction:** A plant grows new individuals from its leaves, stems, roots, or other parts.
   
   * **Budding:** A new plant grows from a bud on the side of the parent plant.
   
   * **Fragmentation:** Pieces of the plant break off and each piece grows into a new plant. 

* **Sexual reproduction:** Involves the fusion of a male and female gamete (reproductive cell) to form a new organism that is genetically unique from either parent. Some examples of sexual reproduction are:

   * **Pollination:** Pollen grains from the male reproductive organ (stamen) are transferred to the female reproductive organ (pistil) either by wind or by insects and animals, then fertilization occurs.
   
   * **Seed production:** After fertilization, the ovules develop into seeds that can be dispersed and grow into new plants.

Plants use both asexual and sexual reproduction to ensure the continuation of their species.
