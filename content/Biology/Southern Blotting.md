# Southern Blotting

Southern Blotting is a laboratory technique used in Molecular Biology. It is named after its inventor, Edwin Southern.

Here is a simple explanation of Southern Blotting:

1. The human body and other living organisms have deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA that stores their genetic information.

2. Southern Blotting is a process that separates DNA molecules based on their sizes to help scientists study and analyze them.

3. The first step in Southern Blotting is to extract DNA molecules from cells.

4. The DNA is then cut into fragments using enzymes to create small pieces that are easier to work with.

5. The fragments are then separated using a process called gel electrophoresis.

6. After separating the fragments, the DNA is then transferred to a nylon membrane or filter paper.

7. The DNA fragments are then sealed onto the membrane using heat or ultraviolet light.

8. Scientists then use labeled probes to identify specific DNA sequences on the membrane.

9. The labeled probes bind to the specific DNA fragments on the membrane and produce an image that can be analyzed and studied.

Southern Blotting is an important technique that helps scientists understand the structure and function of DNA.
