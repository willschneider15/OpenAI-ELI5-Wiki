# Gene Regulation

Gene Regulation is the process by which cells control the expression of their genes.

* Genes are like instructions that tell cells what to do.
* Gene Regulation affects how much a gene is turned on or off.
* It works by either allowing or inhibiting protein synthesis which is an important part of the process of gene expression.
* Gene regulation ensures that each cell type functions properly and can respond to its unique environment.
* The regulation of gene expression is essential because it allows cells to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to stress or stimuli.
