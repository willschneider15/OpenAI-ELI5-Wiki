# Population Dynamics

Population Dynamics is like watching a big family   - you have mom, dad, kids, and maybe grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. Every person has a role to play in the family, just like every animal and plant has a role to play in a population. These roles determine how the population grows or decreases.

* Here are some things that can affect population dynamics:
   * How many individuals are born (birth rate)
   * How many individuals die (death rate)
   * How many individuals move in or out of the population (migration)
   * How much food, water, and space are available to the individuals in the population
   * How many predators or diseases are present in the population's environment

In the family, if mom and dad have lots of kids, but only a small house and a little bit of food, it might be hard for everyone to survive. The same goes for populations in nature. If there are too many individuals and not enough resources to go around, some individuals may die or be forced to move away. On the other hand, if there are lots of resources available and not many predators or diseases, the population may grow quickly. 

Just like every family and every person has a unique story, every population has its own unique set of circumstances that shape its population dynamics.
