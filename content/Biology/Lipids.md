# Lipids

Lipids are like a building block for our bodies. They are a type of molecule or fat that helps us in many ways:

- They provide energy for our body to work
- They help keep our skin and body warm
- They help protect important organs like our heart and brain
- They are important in making hormones which help control things like our mood and blood sugar levels

Lipids can be found in many different types of food we eat such as:

- Avocado, nuts, seeds
- Meat, dairy, eggs
- Oils, butter, mayonnaise

When we eat too many lipids or do not get enough exercise, it can make us unhealthy. We need to make sure we eat a balanced diet and exercise to stay healthy.
