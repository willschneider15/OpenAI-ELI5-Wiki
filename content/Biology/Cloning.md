# Cloning

Cloning means creating an exact copy of a living thing, like a person, animal or plant. Here are some things to consider when explaining cloning to kids:

* Cloning involves taking a cell from an individual and then growing and developing it into a new organism that is genetically identical to the original. 
* It's like making a photocopy of a person or an animal.
* It can happen naturally (like identical twins) or artificially made in a lab using genetic engineering techniques.
* Scientists are still researching on the usefulness of cloning. It can help preserve endangered species, produce genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for food production, and create better medical treatments. 

Cloning raises ethical concerns and is a controversial topic, so it's important to discuss the benefits, risks and ethical considerations related to it. While explaining cloning, it's best to use simple, concrete language and avoid jargon.
