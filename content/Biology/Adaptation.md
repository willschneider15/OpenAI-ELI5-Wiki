# Adaptation

Adaptation is when living things change over time to better suit their environments. 

Living things can change in different ways:
- Some might grow stronger muscles to run faster and catch prey
- Some might develop longer legs to reach tall trees for food
- Some might develop thicker fur to keep warm in the colder climates

All of these changes are called adaptations because they help living things survive in their environment. Adaptations occur slowly over many generations; they are not something that happens overnight.

For example, letâ€™s look at a sloth. Sloths live in trees and move very slowly. They have long claws that help them grip onto branches. Over time, sloths have adapted to their environment by:
- Developing strong muscles to hang from trees
- Growing thick fur to protect them from the cold and rain
- Developing long and sharp claws to help them climb trees

These adaptations have made sloths very successful in their environment. They can move at their own pace and find food easily without having to compete with other animals.
