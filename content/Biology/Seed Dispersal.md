# Seed Dispersal

Seed dispersal is the process of how seeds are spread from one place to another. Here's a brief explanation about seed dispersal which can be understood by a 5-year-old:

* Seeds, just like people, need to travel to new places for them to grow into new plants.
* Some seeds have special structures that let them fly, float, or stick onto animal fur or clothing.
* Other seeds are eaten by animals and then deposited in new locations once the animal poops them out.
* Wind is a primary way that seeds are dispersed, especially for lightweight seeds or seeds with wings like dandelion seeds and maple seeds.
* Water is another way seeds can spread by either floating on water surfaces or sinking to the bottom of bodies of water.
* Animals like birds, squirrels, and humans can also help disperse seeds by carrying them in their mouths, fur, or clothing.

In summary, seed dispersal is an essential process that helps plants grow and survive by letting them spread and grow in new and different environments.
