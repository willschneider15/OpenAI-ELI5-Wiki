# Conservation Biology

Conservation Biology is about helping animals and plants live and grow in the wild.

Here are a few things it involves:

- It helps to save natural places like parks and forests for animals to live in.
- It helps to stop animals from being hurt or killed by people or other animals.
- It helps to make sure there are enough of each type of animal or plant so they don't die out.
- It helps to make sure that different types of animal and plant species can continue to grow and live in the same place without hurting each other.

Conservation Biology is important because it helps to keep our planet healthy and happy. When we take care of the animals and plants around us, we help to keep the air clean, the water fresh and the soil healthy. We also keep ourselves healthy, too!
