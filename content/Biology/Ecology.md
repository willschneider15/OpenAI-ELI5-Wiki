# Ecology

**Ecology is all about the interactions between living things and their environment.**

Here are some key points to help explain this concept to a 5-year-old:

- Ecology is like a big game of "house" but instead of playing with dolls, we're talking about plants, animals, and other living things.
- Everything in an ecosystem, or the place where living things live, is important and has a role to play to help keep things balanced and running smoothly.
- Plants give us oxygen to breathe and animals eat the plants to get energy.
- Animals help to spread plants seeds, making sure new plants grow in different areas.
- If something in the ecosystem changes, like a big storm or people building houses, it can affect how everything else works together.
- Ecologists study how living things interact with each other and their environment to make sure we understand how to keep things healthy and happy for everyone. 

Ecology is a big part of making sure we understand and care for the world around us.
