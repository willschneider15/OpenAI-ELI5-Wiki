# Neurons

Neurons are brain cells that help us think and do things with our body. They work like tiny computers, and there are lots of them in our brain! 

* Neurons take information in through their branches or "dendrites." It's like a telephone wire bringing a message to our brain. 
* Then, the neuron processes the information and decides what to do with it. It's like a really smart person thinking about what to do next. 
* Finally, the neuron sends the message out through its "axon" or "tail," like a messenger delivering a letter. 
* The message travels from neuron to neuron until it gets to where it needs to go. 
* This helps us think, feel, and move our bodies. Every time we learn something new, our neurons are making new connections! 

So, when you learn something new or do something like ride a bike, it's because your neurons are working hard and talking to each other to make it happen.
