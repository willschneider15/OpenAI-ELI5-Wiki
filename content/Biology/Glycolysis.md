# Glycolysis

Glycolysis is the process by which our bodies create energy from the food we eat. Here is a quick and easy explanation of glycolysis that anyone can understand:

- Glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm of our cells
- Think of it like breaking down a bunch of Legos into smaller pieces to build something new
- Glycolysis starts with glucose, which is like the big Lego brick that you start with
- Enzymes break glucose down into smaller molecules called pyruvate, which is like breaking the big Lego brick into smaller pieces
- This process produces a little bit of energy, like when you use a battery to power a toy
- This energy can be used right away by our cells, or it can be stored for later use
- If there's not enough oxygen around to keep breaking down pyruvate, our cells can use it to make a chemical called lactic acid, which can build up and make our muscles feel sore.

That's it! Glycolysis is a complicated process, but thinking of it like breaking down Legos can help make it easier to understand.
