# Gene Flow

**Gene Flow**

Gene flow is the term used to describe the movement of genes or alleles (different forms of a gene) between populations. It's like people moving from one town to another.

* It occurs when individuals, gametes (reproductive cells), or seeds move between populations.
* Gene flow can introduce new genetic variation into a population, or alter existing genetic variation.
* It can increase genetic diversity and help populations adapt to changing environments, or it can homogenize populations and reduce genetic diversity.
* Gene flow can be influenced by factors such as geographic barriers, mating preferences, and dispersal behaviors.
* It often happens more between populations that are close together, rather than far apart. 

In summary, gene flow is extremely important because it can facilitate evolution by either introducing novel genetic diversity into populations or homogenizing the genetic makeup of different populations.
