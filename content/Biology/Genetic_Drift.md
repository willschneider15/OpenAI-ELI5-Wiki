# Genetic Drift

- Genetic Drift is a natural process of how certain traits of a specific population or species can become more or less prominent due to chance events.
- It is a random event or force that affects the frequency of alleles (different forms of a gene) in a population.
- This process can cause the loss or fixation of alleles over time, meaning certain traits become more or less common, in a population due to random factors.
- Genetic Drift can happen in small populations where chance alone can play a larger role in genetic makeup.
- The effect of genetic drift is typically stronger in smaller populations as it is random events are more likely to have a significant impact on smaller groups.
- It can lead to the differentiation of populations, causing differences in traits and frequencies that may not exist in larger populations.
- Genetic Drift is one of the mechanisms of evolution that affect how populations evolve and change over time.
