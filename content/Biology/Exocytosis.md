# Exocytosis

Exocytosis is when a cell sends something out of its body

* It’s like a delivery guy dropping off a package at someone’s house
* But instead of a guy, it’s a cell doing the delivering
* And instead of a package, it could be a protein or a waste product that the cell wants to get rid of
* The cell puts the protein or waste product into a bubble-like structure called a vesicle
* The vesicle then moves towards the cell membrane, which is like the front door of the cell
* When the vesicle reaches the cell membrane, it merges with it
* This causes the vesicle to burst open and release whatever was inside of it to the outside of the cell
* Just like how the delivery guy leaves the package at the front door and walks away
