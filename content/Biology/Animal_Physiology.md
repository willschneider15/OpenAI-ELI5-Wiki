# Animal Physiology

Animal physiology is the study of how animals work inside. It is like studying how a car works, but instead of gears and engines, it looks at the body parts of animals and how they function.

* It studies animals' organs, tissues, and cells.
* It looks at how the animals digest food, breathe in air, and get rid of waste.
* It studies animals' muscles and how they move.
* It sees how animals' nervous system controls their body functions.
* It also looks at how animals adapt to their surroundings and survive in their habitats.

By studying animal physiology, scientists can learn how animals survive and thrive in their environment. They can use this knowledge to develop treatments for animals that are sick or injured. They can even apply this knowledge to human physiology to help us understand how our own bodies work.
