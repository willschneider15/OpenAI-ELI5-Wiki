# Biochemistry

Biochemistry is a fancy word that means understanding the basic chemistry that happens in living things. It is the study of the chemical processes and substances that happen inside of living things, like people, plants, and animals.

Here are some things to know:

- All living things are made of cells, which are tiny building blocks that help living things grow and survive.
- Cells are made up of molecules, which are even tinier parts that have different jobs.
- Biochemistry helps us understand how these molecules work together to keep living things alive.
- Biochemists study things like enzymes, which help chemical reactions happen in cells, and DNA, which carries the genetic information that determines what an organism looks like and how it behaves.
- Biochemistry helps us understand how living things get the energy they need to live.
- By studying biochemistry, we can learn how to make new medicines and treatments for diseases. 

So, biochemistry is all about understanding how tiny molecules work together to keep living things alive, and how we can use that understanding to make the world a better, healthier place!
