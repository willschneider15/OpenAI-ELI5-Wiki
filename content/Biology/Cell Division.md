# Cell Division

Cell division is the process by which living organisms grow and repair themselves. Humans (and other living things) are made up of millions of tiny cells, which are like little building blocks. 

* When a cell becomes too big, or when it is damaged, it needs to divide into two new cells. 
* This happens in two main stages: 
  * First, the cell copies all of its DNA (which is like the "brain" of the cell). 
  * Then, it divides into two new cells, each with its own copy of the DNA. 
* There are two main types of cell division: 
  * Mitosis: This is when one cell divides into two identical cells. This is how the body grows and repairs itself. 
  * Meiosis: This is a special type of cell division that happens only in sex cells (like sperm and egg cells). Meiosis makes sure that each new offspring gets half of its DNA from each parent. 

In summary, cell division is a vital process that allows living organisms to grow, repair themselves, and reproduce.
