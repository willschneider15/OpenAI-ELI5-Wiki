# Northern Blotting

Northern Blotting is a technique used in biological research for detecting RNA molecules, which are responsible for carrying genetic information from DNA to the rest of the cell. 

Here's how it works:

1. Researchers extract RNA from cells and cut it into small fragments.
2. These fragments are separated on a gel according to their size. 
3. The fragments are transferred from the gel onto a special membrane, where they are immobilized. 
4. A probe - a small, labeled piece of DNA - is added to the membrane. 
5. The probe binds to complementary RNA fragments on the membrane, allowing researchers to visualize the presence of specific RNA molecules. 

Think of it like trying to find a specific toy in a pile of toys. You take all the toys out and put them in a line, then you look for the one you want by checking each toy until you find it. 

The Northern Blotting technique helps researchers identify specific RNA molecules in a sample, which can be useful for studying gene expression and understanding how cells function.
