# Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

PCR is a technique used in laboratories to make copies of a specific piece of DNA.

PCR works by using a tiny machine called a thermocycler, which can quickly change the temperature of a sample.

* First, a scientist adds the DNA sample to a test tube with special chemicals, including DNA primers (which are like "start" signs for the PCR process), nucleotides (DNA building blocks), and a special enzyme called "polymerase."
* The tube is then placed in the thermocycler, which runs a series of temperature cycles:

     * First, it heats up to 94-96°C to "melt" the DNA strands apart.
     * Then, it cools to around 50-60°C so the primers can attach to the DNA.
     * Finally, it heats up again to 72°C, which is the optimal temperature for the polymerase enzyme to work and build new strands of DNA.

* This cycle is repeated over and over again, resulting in millions of copies of the original DNA segment. 

PCR is an important tool for many fields of science, from forensics to medicine, because it allows scientists to study and identify even tiny amounts of DNA.
