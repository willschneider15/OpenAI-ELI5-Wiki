# Seeds

Seeds are like little magic houses where new plants are created. Here's what you need to know:

- Seeds are tiny packages that contain everything a plant needs to grow into a full plant including the embryo and all the nutrients required like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 
- The plant embryo is like a little baby plant that will eventually grow roots, stems, and leaves once it is planted in the soil. 
- Seeds can be different shapes, sizes, and colors depending on the type of plant. They can also have hard shells or be soft, and can be eaten by animals or humans or used to grow plants. 
- Seeds need water, air, and warmth to grow into a full plant, and each seed has a unique process of germination or sprouting into a new plant. 
- Farmers and gardeners use seeds to grow crops such as vegetables, fruits, and grains, as well as plants for decoration and landscaping. 
- The seed industry is a big business with companies producing and selling seeds for different types of plants all over the world.

Seeds are important parts of our environment, providing food and beauty, and ensuring the continuation of plant life.
