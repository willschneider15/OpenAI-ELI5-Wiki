# Metabolomics

Metabolomics is like looking at all the tiny machines inside your body to see how they're working. Just like big machines have gears and cogs, your body has tiny machines called enzymes that help make energy and other important stuff. Metabolomics looks at all the different kinds of molecules that your body makes and uses like tiny puzzle pieces. It helps scientists understand how these molecules fit together and how they help your body work. Here are some important things to remember:

- Metabolomics is the study of all the tiny molecules inside your body that help it function.
- Just like a puzzle, all these molecules fit together to make your body work properly.
- Scientists use metabolomics to understand how these molecules interact and how changes in their levels can affect your health.
- Metabolomics can help doctors diagnose and treat diseases by looking at changes in the levels of these molecules.
- Metabolomics can also help researchers develop new drugs that work better and have fewer side effects.
