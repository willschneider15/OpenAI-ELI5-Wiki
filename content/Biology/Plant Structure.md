# Plant Structure

Plants are living organisms that can grow on land and in water. Like animals, they have a complex structure which consists of different parts who work together to help the plant grow and survive. Here's everything you need to know about plant structures:

* **Roots:** These are the parts of the plant that you don't usually see because they are underground. They anchor the plant to the soil and absorb water and nutrients from it. When we eat a plant, we often eat its roots, like carrots.

* **Stems:** Stems are the parts of the plant that grow above ground. They are responsible for supporting the plant and for sending water and nutrients from the roots up to the leaves. Stems can be woody or soft, depending on the type of plant. The most common use of stems is to produce vegetables, like broccoli and celery.

* **Leaves:** Leaves are the parts of the plant that are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their own food. They are typically thin and flat to capture sunlight efficiently. The stem delivers water and nutrients to the leaves through a system of veins. Some leaves can be eaten, like spinach and lettuce.

* **Flowers:** Flowers are the parts of the plant that produce seeds. They are often beautiful and colorful because they are meant to attract pollinators, like bees and butterflies. From the flowers, fruits are produced, like apples and mangoes.

* **Fruits and seeds:** Fruits and seeds are the parts of the plant that are used to reproduce. Fruits can be eaten or used to make products like jams and jellies. Seeds are important because they can be used to grow new plants.

Understanding the structure of plants is important because it helps us know how they grow, how to care for them, and how to use them for food and other products.
