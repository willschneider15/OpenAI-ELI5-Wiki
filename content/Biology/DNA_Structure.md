# DNA Structure

Just as a house is made of bricks, our body is made of millions of tiny parts called cells. Inside the cells is a special part called the nucleus, which is like the brain of the cell. It controls everything that the cell does. 

- DNA is a special molecule found inside the nucleus of the cell. It holds all the instructions to make you unique, like your hair color, eye color, and even how tall you will be!

- DNA looks like a twisted ladder, with different kinds of rungs called base pairs. The base pairs are labeled A, T, C, and G. 

- A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G. This is like a secret code that tells your body what to do!

- The order of these base pairs is extremely important for DNA to function correctly. Consider the order of these letters like a recipe - too little of one or too much of another, the end result won't be the same.

- Humans have about 20,000-25,000 genes, or recipes, that dictate how our bodies work. 

- By studying your DNA, scientists can learn more about your unique traits and possibly even find ways to treat certain diseases. 

- DNA is magical because it makes you who you are!
