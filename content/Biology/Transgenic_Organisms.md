# Transgenic Organisms

A **Transgenic organism** is a plant or an animal that has been genetically modified by introducing genes from another species. Scientists do this by inserting a piece of DNA from one organism into another organism to create a new organism with traits that were not present before. Here are some important things to know about transgenic organisms:

* Transgenic organisms are created in order to give them new and useful traits, such as increased resistance to disease, pests or to produce more food.

* This kind of genetic modification is mostly used in agriculture and food production systems.

* Transgenic plants are generally used to produce crops that are more resistant to pests and herbicides, which can help limit the need for pesticides and herbicides, as well as reduce the presence of these chemicals in the environment.

* Transgenic animals are created for research purposes such as the study of diseases or to produce certain substances that may be helpful for human health and well-being.

* Some risks associated with transgenic organisms include potential ecological impact, spread of genes to wild populations, and the possibility of negative health impacts on humans and animals.

Overall, transgenic organisms are important in fields like agriculture and biotechnology as they have the potential to create new breakthroughs and innovations that can benefit both the environment and human health.
