# Genetic Engineering

Genetic engineering is like baking a cake. Just like you use different ingredients to make a cake, scientists use different pieces of DNA to create a new or improved organism.

* Scientists decide what traits they want to add or remove from an organism
* They search for the DNA sequences that control those traits
  * It's like finding the right ingredients for a cake recipe
* They use specialized tools to cut and paste the DNA sequences to create a new combination
  * Just like mixing ingredients in a cake recipe
* The new DNA is then put back into an organism, changing the way its traits are expressed
  * The organism has now been *engineered* to have desirable traits that it didn't have before

Genetic engineering can be used for many things, such as:

* Developing crops that are resistant to pests and diseases
* Creating medicines that cure diseases
* Producing animals that grow faster and provide more meat or milk
* Helping scientists study the functions of specific genes
