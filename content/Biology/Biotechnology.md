# Biotechnology

Biotechnology is a way of using living things like bacteria, plants and animals to make useful products for humans. It involves using our knowledge of their genetic makeup to change or improve them in specific ways. 

Some examples of biotechnology are:

* Making insulin for diabetics by genetically modifying bacteria to produce it
* Creating genetically modified crops that are resistant to pests or disease 
* Using bacteria to clean up oil spills or polluted water

Biotechnology can help us solve problems in many fields like medicine, agriculture, and the environment. 

Overall, biotechnology is about harnessing the power of biology to make our lives better.
