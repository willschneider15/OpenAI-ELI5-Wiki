# Gravitropism

Gravitropism is how plants grow towards or away from gravity. Here's how to explain it to a 5-year-old:

* Gravitropism is when plants know which way is up and which way is down, and they grow in the right direction.
* When a seed is planted, it starts to grow down into the soil to find water and nutrients. This is called negative gravitropism.
* Once the stem of a plant breaks through the surface of the soil, it starts to grow up towards the sun. This is called positive gravitropism.
* This is because the plant can sense which way is down because of gravity. The root part of the plant is sensitive to gravity and grows down, while the shoot part of the plant is less sensitive and grows up.
* If you turn a plant upside down, the plant will eventually figure out which way is up and start to grow towards the light. This is because the plant is still sensitive to gravity and it's trying to find the light source which is usually at the top.
