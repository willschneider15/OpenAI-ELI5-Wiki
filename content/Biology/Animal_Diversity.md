# Animal Diversity

Animal Diversity refers to the variety of different animals that exist in the world. From tiny insects to huge elephants, there is an incredible range of shapes, sizes and forms that animals take! Here are some key concepts to keep in mind:

- There are millions of different species of animals on Earth
- Some animals are so small you can barely see them and others are so large they can weigh over 100 tons!
- Animals can be divided into different groups based on their characteristics, such as whether they have fur or feathers, lay eggs or give birth to live young, or have scales or a hard shell
- Each animal has its own unique adaptations that help it survive in its environment, such as camouflage to hide from predators, sharp claws for hunting, or wings for flying
- The study of animal diversity helps us better understand the incredible variety of life on our planet, and how all living things are interconnected and dependent on each other for survival

Overall, animal diversity is a fascinating and important part of biology that helps us appreciate the incredible range of life all around us!
