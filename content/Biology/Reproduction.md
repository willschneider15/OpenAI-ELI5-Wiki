# Reproduction

**Reproduction** is when living things make babies that are similar to them. There are two types of reproduction: **sexual** and **asexual**.

**Asexual Reproduction**
* Only one parent is involved 
* The baby is an exact copy of its parent 
* Bacteria and some animals like starfish and worms can reproduce asexually 
* Itâ€™s quick, easy, and efficient, but can create problems with genetic diversity 

**Sexual Reproduction**
* Two parents are involved 
* The baby is a combination of both parents 
* Humans, animals, and most plants reproduce sexually 
* It takes longer, but creates genetic diversity and variations in offspring 
* The male contributes a sperm and the female contributes an egg that come together to form a zygote 

Overall, reproduction is how living things create offspring that are similar to them, and it can happen in two different ways: asexual or sexual reproduction.
