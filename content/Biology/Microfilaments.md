# Microfilaments

**Microfilaments** are tiny structures that make up a part of our cells called the cytoskeleton, which gives our cells their shape and helps them move. Microfilaments are like the bones and muscles of our cells.

* They are made up of a protein called actin.
* They are very small, only about 7 nanometers in diameter.
* They are very flexible and can change shape quickly.
* They grow and shrink as they are needed, helping cells to move and change shape.
* They are important for many cell functions, including cell division, muscle contraction, and cell movement. 

Think of microfilaments like the strings of a puppet that help the puppet move and form its shape. In the same way, microfilaments support our cells and help them move and take on different shapes.
