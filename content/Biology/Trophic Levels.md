# Trophic Levels

**Trophic Levels**

- Trophic levels are like a ladder that shows who eats who in a food chain.
- There are four trophic levels: 
   1. Producers (plants) which make their food using sunlight
   2. Primary consumers (herbivores) which eat the plants
   3. Secondary consumers (carnivores) which eat the primary consumers
   4. Tertiary consumers (top carnivores) which eat the secondary consumers

- The arrows in the food chain indicate the direction of energy flow.
- Producers get their energy from the sun and store it in their tissues.
- The energy stored by the producers is transferred to the primary consumers when they eat the plants.
- This energy is then passed to the secondary and tertiary consumers when they eat the primary and secondary consumers respectively. 
- At each trophic level, only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level. 
- The rest of the energy is used by the organism for various metabolic processes such as breathing, digestion, and movement.
- Hence, the number of organisms in each trophic level decreases as we move up the food chain.
- This is why the top predators such as lions, tigers or sharks are fewer in number than the herbivores or primary consumers.
