# Calvin Cycle

The Calvin cycle is a process that happens in plants that allows them to create food. Here is a brief explanation of the concept: 

* The process takes place in the chloroplasts of plants, which are the organelles responsible for capturing light energy from the sun
* The Calvin cycle also requires CO2 from the air, which is taken in through small openings on the leaves of the plant called stomata
* During the cycle, the CO2 is used to create sugars that the plant can use as energy
* The cycle is made up of a series of chemical reactions that require energy stored in the ATP and NADPH molecules that were created during an earlier step called the light-dependent reaction
* The Calvin cycle also produces oxygen as a byproduct, which is released into the air 

In short, the Calvin cycle is a process that allows plants to convert energy from the sun and carbon dioxide from the air into usable food.
