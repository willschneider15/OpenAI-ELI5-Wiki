# Vaccines

Vaccines are like superheroes for your body! They teach your body how to fight and defeat bad germs, called viruses and bacteria, so you don't get sick from them. 

Here's how they work:

- Scientists study viruses and bacteria that make people very sick.
- Scientists create a harmless version of the bad germ, called a vaccine.
- The vaccine is given to your body through a shot or a nasal spray, and your immune system gets to meet and learn from the harmless, but pretending-to-be-bad germ.
- Your immune system remembers how to defeat the bad germ by creating special fighters, called antibodies.
- Later, if real bad germs try to invade your body, your immune system already knows how to defeat them with the help of the antibodies and superhero white blood cells.

Thanks to vaccines, many diseases like polio, measles, and rubella that used to make lots of people sick are now very rare, if not completely eliminated.
