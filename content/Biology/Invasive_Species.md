# Invasive Species

An **invasive species** is like a bad guy who comes from a different place and starts causing trouble in your neighborhood. 

* Every living thing has a role to play in its own environment, but when an outsider shows up, it can disrupt the whole system. 

* Invasive species usually have no natural predator or limit to their population growth, so they reproduce really quickly and can take over. 

* They often outcompete native species for resources like food, water, and shelter, causing some species to die out entirely. 

* Sometimes invasive species can also spread disease or parasites that the natives have no defenses against. 

* It's important to prevent the spread of invasive species by not introducing them to new areas and by controlling their population if they do invade. 

* This can be done through things like physical removal, biological control (introducing a predator of the invasive species), or chemical treatments. 

* By protecting native species and their ecosystems, we can help maintain a healthy and balanced environment.
