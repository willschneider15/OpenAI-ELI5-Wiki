# Genetic Code

- Our body is made up of cells and cells are like tiny factories or machines that do different jobs.
- Just like a machine needs a manual or instruction book to work properly, cells also need instruction to do their job.
- In our bodies, DNA is like a manual or instruction book that tells each cell what to do.
- DNA is made up of four different letters - A, T, C, and G. These four letters are like the alphabets of DNA language.
- Just like how different words are made by combining different alphabets, cells use different combinations of A, T, C, and G to make different instructions.
- The instructions that DNA gives are very important because they tell cells what type of cell to become, how to function, and how to divide.
- The genetic code is like a secret language that cells use to read the instruction book (DNA) and make sure everything runs smoothly in our bodies.

Overall, the genetic code is the language that cells use to interpret the information in DNA and carry out the instructions it provides. It's like a secret code that helps our body function properly.
