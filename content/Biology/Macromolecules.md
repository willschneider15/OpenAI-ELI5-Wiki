# Macromolecules

Macromolecules are made up of lots of smaller pieces called molecules. They are very important in biology because they make up living things like you and me! There are 4 main types of macromolecules:

* **Carbohydrates** - These are molecules made up of sugars. They are like the fuel that gives our bodies energy.

* **Lipids** - These are molecules like fats and oils. They help store energy, insulate our bodies, and make up cell membranes.

* **Proteins** - These are molecules that do a lot of different things in our bodies. They help build and repair tissues, move molecules around our cells, and can even act like little machines!

* **Nucleic acids** - These are molecules like DNA and RNA. They help store and transmit genetic information so that our bodies can grow and function properly.

So, macromolecules are really important because they make up living things and help us do things like move and think!
