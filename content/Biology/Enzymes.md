# Enzymes

Enzymes are like magic chemical scissors that help us break down food!

Here are some key points:
- Enzymes are special types of proteins
- Our body needs enzymes to help with breaking down food and other important chemical reactions
- They really, really love specific types of molecules
- When they find one of their favorite molecules, they wrap it up and snip it into tiny pieces!
- Different enzymes like different types of molecules, just like how different kids like different types of candy
- Enzymes have really funny names like "lactase" which helps us digest milk, and "amylase" which helps us digest sugar
- Without enzymes, our body wouldn't be able to function properly, because we wouldn't be able to digest food or do other important chemical reactions that our body needs to stay healthy.

So, next time you eat your favorite snack or meal, remember that enzymes are working hard in your body to help you break it down and use it for energy. Yum!
