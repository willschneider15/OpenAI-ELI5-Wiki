# Animal Classification

Animal Classification

* Scientists group animals based on their similar characteristics.
* This is called **animal classification**.
* Animal classification helps identify new animals, understand their similarities, and explain differences.
* There are 2 main groups of animals: **vertebrates** and **invertebrates**.
  * **Vertebrates** are animals with backbones, such as fish, birds, and humans.
  * **Invertebrates** are animals without backbones, such as insects and worms.
* Both vertebrates and invertebrates are further divided into different groups based on their features.
* These groups include:
  * **Mammals**: animals that have hair or fur, breathe air, give birth to live young, and produce milk for their young.
  * **Birds**: animals with feathers, wings, and a beak who lay eggs.
  * **Reptiles**: animals with scaly skin, breathe air, and lay eggs.
  * **Amphibians**: animals with smooth, moist skin who breathe through their skin, and lay eggs in water.
  * **Fish**: animals that live in water, breathe through gills, and lay eggs.
  * **Arthropods**: animals with exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed legs, such as insects, spiders, and crustaceans.
* Each group of animals has its own unique characteristics that help separate it from other groups.
