# Population Genetics

Population genetics is all about genes and how they change over time in groups of animals, plants, or other living things. It focuses on:

* How genetic traits are passed down from parents to their offspring.
* How different populations of organisms change over time.
* How genes can change as a result of natural selection, migration, and other factors.

Here are some key concepts to keep in mind:

* Genes are the basic units of heredity.
* Each individual organism has two copies of each gene, one from each parent.
* Genetic diversity in a population can be affected by factors like mutations and genetic drift.
* Natural selection favors certain traits that help organisms survive and reproduce.
* Over time, small genetic changes can add up and lead to new species.

So, population genetics is all about understanding how and why genes change in different groups of organisms. This information can help scientists better understand evolution and how organisms adapt to changing environments.
