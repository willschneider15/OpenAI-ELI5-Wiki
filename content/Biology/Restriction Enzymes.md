# Restriction Enzymes

Restriction Enzymes:
* Restriction enzymes are like tiny molecular scissors that cut DNA molecules.
* They are proteins produced by bacteria to cut foreign DNA from viruses that attack them.
* Each enzyme recognizes a particular sequence of DNA bases and cuts it, leaving behind sticky ends or blunt ends.
* Sticky ends are like Velcro and allow DNA fragments cut with the same enzyme to be joined back together.
* Blunt ends don't have overhanging strands, so they can't be joined to other blunt ends.
* Restriction enzymes are used in many molecular biology techniques such as DNA fingerprinting, cloning, and gene editing.
* Scientists use restriction enzymes to cut DNA from different organisms and insert them into other organisms to create genetically modified organisms. 

In conclusion, restriction enzymes are important molecular tools that have revolutionized modern biology by enabling scientists to manipulate genes and DNA sequences.
