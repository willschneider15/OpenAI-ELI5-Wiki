# Epigenetics

Epigenetics is like an instruction manual for your body. Think of it like a light switch that can turn genes on or off. 

* Your genes are the instructions that tell your body what to do.
* Epigenetics is how your body decides which of those instructions to follow.
* Different factors, like what you eat or how much you exercise, can trigger your epigenetics and change how your genes work.
* Sometimes these changes can be passed down to your children and even their children too.
* So, if you take good care of yourself and make healthy choices, you can help to make sure that your body follows the best possible instruction manual.
