# Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is a process that cells go through as they grow and divide. The cell cycle has four main stages:

- G1 (Gap 1): The cell grows and increases in size. It also makes new proteins and organelles.
- S (Synthesis): The cell replicates its DNA, so it now contains two identical copies.
- G2 (Gap 2): The cell continues to grow and prepares to divide.
- M (Mitosis): The cell divides into two identical daughter cells, with each daughter cell receiving one copy of the replicated DNA.

The cell cycle is important for many reasons:

- Growth: The cell cycle allows organisms to grow and develop.
- Repair: The cell cycle allows damaged cells to be replaced by healthy new cells.
- Reproduction: The cell cycle allows organisms to reproduce by producing new cells (e.g. sperm and egg cells).

Abnormal cell cycles can lead to diseases such as cancer, where cells divide uncontrollably and can invade other tissues. Understanding the cell cycle can help us develop treatments for diseases that involve abnormal cell growth.
