# Population Ecology

Population ecology is the study of the relationship between living things and the environment in which they live. This concept can be explained to a 5-year-old by using the following examples:

* Imagine a group of birds living in a tree. This is a population.
* Now imagine what the birds need to survive: food, water, and a place to make a nest. These factors are called resources.
* If there are not enough resources for all the birds, some will not be able to survive.
* This means that the number of birds in the population may increase or decrease depending on the availability of resources.
* Scientists who study population ecology look at things like migration patterns, birth and death rates, and the effects of natural disasters on populations.

In summary, population ecology is all about how living things interact with their environment, and how their population size might change over time.
