# Biogeography

Biogeography is the study of how living things are distributed across the world. It's like a big puzzle where we try to figure out why certain animals and plants live in certain places. 

To explain it to a 5 year old:
- Imagine playing a game of hide and seek, but instead of people hiding, it's plants and animals.
- Some animals like polar bears live in cold places like the Arctic, while others like kangaroos live in hot places like Australia. 
- Similarly, some plants like cacti can only survive in dry deserts, while others like orchids need lots of rain and humidity to grow. 
- Scientists study things like climate, geography, and history to try to understand why certain living things live where they do.
