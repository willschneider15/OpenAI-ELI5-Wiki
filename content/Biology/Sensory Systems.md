# Sensory Systems

Sensory systems are like detectives inside our bodies. Here's how they work:

* All around us, there are millions of tiny particles called "stimuli." We can't see them, but we can feel them!
* Our bodies have a special set of "detectives" called sensory receptors. They're like tiny cameras or microphones, and they're always on the lookout for stimuli.
* When a sensory receptor detects a stimulus, it sends a signal along a nerve to the brain.
* The brain then interprets this signal and decides how to respond. For example, if a sensory receptor in your nose detects a delicious smell, your brain might tell you to follow your nose and find the source of that smell.
* Different sensory receptors are specialized for different types of stimuli. For example, the sensory receptors in our eyes are specialized for detecting light, while the receptors in our ears are specialized for detecting sound.
* In addition to our five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), we also have other sensory systems that help us sense things like pain, temperature, and balance.
