# Animal Reproduction

Animal Reproduction is how animals make babies. Here are some important things to know:

- Animals have reproductive organs that allow them to have babies. Male animals have one set of organs and female animals have another set of organs.
- Some animals can have babies all by themselves, but most animals need to mate with a member of the opposite sex to have babies.
- When animals mate, the sperm from the male animal combines with the egg from the female animal to make a fertilized egg.
- This fertilized egg then grows into a baby animal inside the female animal's body. Depending on the animal, the baby animal might grow in an egg outside the female's body or internally.
- When the baby animal is big enough, it is born. Some animals are born fully formed, while others need to grow some more after they are born.
- The process of giving birth can be different for different animals. Some animals give birth to their babies through a birth canal, while others lay eggs that hatch later.
- Once a baby animal is born, it needs to grow and develop, just like human babies do.
