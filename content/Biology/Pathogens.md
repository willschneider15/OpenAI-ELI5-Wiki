# Pathogens

Pathogens are bad germs that like to make you sick. Just like how not all bugs are butterflies, not all germs are bad. Some germs are good for our body and help us stay healthy.

But some bad germs, called pathogens, can make us very sick. They are so small that we can't even see them with our eyes! 

These pathogens can spread from person to person if we touch them, breathe them in, or eat them. Some examples of pathogens include: 

- Bacteria: tiny little living things that can cause infections if they get into our body 
- Viruses: even smaller than bacteria, they can also cause infections and can only live and reproduce inside our body 
- Fungi: like mushrooms or yeasts, but some types can cause infections too
- Parasites: small creatures like worms, ticks, and fleas that can live on or inside our body and make us sick.

Pathogens can make us feel really bad but there are ways to protect ourselves like washing our hands, cleaning surfaces, covering our mouth when we cough or sneeze, and staying home when we are sick.
