# Thermoregulation

Thermoregulation is how your body controls its temperature. Just like you put on a coat when it's cold outside and take it off when it's hot, your body has ways to adjust to different temperatures to stay comfortable. 

* When you're cold, your body will shiver to create heat.
* When you're hot, you might sweat to cool down.
* Your body can also widen or narrow your blood vessels to regulate temperature 
* All these actions work together to maintain a constant body temperature. 

This is important because your body is designed to work best at a specific temperature. If it gets too hot or too cold, things can start to go wrong. So, thermoregulation helps keep everything running smoothly.
