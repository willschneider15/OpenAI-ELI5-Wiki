# Bacteria

Bacteria are tiny living things that are everywhere around us, but we can't see them without a microscope! They're so small that you could fit about a billion of them on the tip of a pencil. Here's what you need to know about these little creatures:

- Bacteria are single-celled organisms, which means they're made up of just one cell.
- They come in many different shapes, like spheres, rods, and spirals.
- Some bacteria can be helpful to us, like the ones that live in our gut and help us digest our food.
- Other bacteria can make us sick, causing illnesses like strep throat, food poisoning, and pneumonia.
- We can kill harmful bacteria with things like antibiotics, but we have to be careful not to overuse them, or else the bacteria can become resistant to them.
- Even though we often think of bacteria as bad, they actually play an important role in the world around us, helping to break down dead plants and animals and cycling nutrients back into the soil. 

So, the next time you hear the word "bacteria," remember that they're not all bad - and that they're all around us, whether we can see them or not!
