# Bioethics

**Bioethics** is all about making right choices related to biology and science. It is used to guide people in their decision-making process to create a better future for individuals, communities, and the environment.

Bioethics has some things to think about:

* Safety: ensuring that people are not harmed
* Benefits: evaluating if the benefits of something outweigh the risks
* Autonomy: respecting individual choices and values
* Justice: understanding the fairness of decisions

Bioethics is important because it helps people to:

* Think critically: to analyze and evaluate things to make a decision
* Make informed decisions: to understand what the implications of the choices
* Consider different perspectives: often there are many aspects to a decision
* Hold people accountable: when something goes wrong, there are guidelines in place to understand how to rectify the situation.

Bioethics helps society progress and develop scientifically in a responsible and ethical manner.
