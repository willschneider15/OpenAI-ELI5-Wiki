# Phototropism

Phototropism is the way a plant grows towards light.

* A plant needs light to live.
* When a plant is in darkness, it will grow in a random direction.
* But when there is light, a plant will grow towards the light.
* This is called phototropism.
* Phototropism is important because it helps the plant get the light it needs to live.
* If a plant does not have enough light, it will not be able to grow and will eventually die.
* Phototropism is why you might see a potted plant bending towards the window or why sunflowers follow the sun.

In short, phototropism helps a plant get the light it needs to survive by growing towards the source of light.
