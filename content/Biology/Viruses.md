# Viruses

A virus is a tiny thing that can make you sick. Think about it like a tiny robber - it sneaks into your body and tries to take control. Here's how it works:

* A virus is made of a few parts: the outer shell, genetic material (like DNA or RNA), and sometimes a tail or little legs.

* When someone who is sick with a virus coughs or sneezes, the virus can get out of their body and into the air.

* If you breathe in the virus or touch something that has the virus on it, like a doorknob, it can get into your body.

* Once inside your body, the virus tries to find a cell to take over. It attaches to the cell and then injects its genetic material into the cell.

* The virus's genetic material tells the cell to make more viruses instead of doing its normal job, like keeping you healthy.

* The new viruses then leave the cell and go on to infect more cells, making you even sicker.
