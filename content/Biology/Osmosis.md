# Osmosis

Osmosis is a process that happens in living things, where water moves from an area where there is lots of it to an area where there is less of it. Here are the main points to help you understand:

* Water moves from where there is more of it to where there is less of it, through a special kind of doorway called a semi-permeable membrane.
* A semi-permeable membrane is like a super-fine mesh that lets water through but not much else.
* Living things, like cells in your body, have semi-permeable membranes that help keep things balanced.
* When there is more water outside the cell than inside, water will move into the cell until they are balanced.
* The opposite also happens: when there is more water inside the cell than outside, water will move out of the cell until they are balanced.
* Osmosis is important because it helps keep cells and living things healthy and hydrated.
