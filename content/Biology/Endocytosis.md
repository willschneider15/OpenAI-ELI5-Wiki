# Endocytosis

Endocytosis is a process where the cell takes in (engulfs) materials from the outside by forming a bubble-like vesicle around them. This process is divided into three types:

* Phagocytosis: This is like the cell eating up solid materials (like a large meal). 
* Pinocytosis: This is similar to drinking liquids in small quantities. 
* Receptor-mediated endocytosis: This is a bit like a bouncer at a club -- specific molecules (VIPs) are allowed through the door (in this case, the cell membrane).

Endocytosis is important for cells because it allows them to:

* Bring in nutrients and molecules 
* Regulate the number of molecules on the cell surface 
* Allow cells to take up molecules that they produce as part of their normal functions (such as hormones)

Endocytosis is also important for defending the body against disease-causing microbes.
