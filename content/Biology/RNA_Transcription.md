# RNA Transcription

RNA Transcription is like copying a recipe from one book to another so that you can make the dish. In this case, our recipe is DNA-based instructions for making different proteins.

* DNA is like a cookbook full of recipes (genes).
* RNA polymerase is like a chef that reads the recipe (gene) and copies it.
* The copied recipe is like RNA, and it can move to a different part of the cell to create a protein.
* The process of making the RNA copy is called transcription.
* The RNA copy is just like DNA, but with a different sugar molecule that makes it easier to move around in the cell.
