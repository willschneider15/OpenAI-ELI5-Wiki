# Light-dependent Reactions

Light-dependent reactions are a way for plants to turn sunlight into energy. 

It works like this:

* Sunlight hits the plant's leaves and is absorbed by pigments called chlorophyll.
* The energy from the sunlight is transferred to molecules called ATP and NADPH.
* These molecules are used in the next step of photosynthesis (called the Calvin cycle) to turn carbon dioxide into glucose (sugar).
* Oxygen is also produced as a byproduct of this process.

So, light-dependent reactions are the first step of photosynthesis, and they provide the energy needed for plants to make their own food!
