# Speciation

Speciation is the process of creating new species from existing ones. This happens when a group of organisms becomes separated from the rest of their kind and starts evolving on its own. Over time, these differences can become so great that the two groups can no longer interbreed and form viable offspring. Here are some key points to understand:
- A species is a group of living organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
- Populations of the same species can become separated by geographic, reproductive or behavioral barriers.
- Isolation of two groups creates genetic differences as each group is exposed to different environmental pressures.
- Over time, these differences can become so great that the two groups can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
- At this point, they are considered different species that have their unique characteristics and evolutionary paths.

In short, speciation is the process of creating new species over time after the separation of populations.
