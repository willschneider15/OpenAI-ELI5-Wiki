# Circulation

Circulation is like delivering groceries!

* Just like we need to deliver groceries to different parts of our homes, our bodies need to deliver important things like oxygen, food and waste to different parts of our bodies.

* Our heart acts like a delivery person carrying these important things (blood) in a truck (blood vessels).

* These trucks (blood vessels) are like roads, carrying the blood to different parts of our body (cells, tissues and organs) so that they can get what they need (like oxygen) and give back what they donâ€™t need (like waste).

* The heart pumps the blood around the body, using different routes (arteries and veins), to make sure everything gets delivered and picked up.

* Without circulation, our bodies wouldn't be able to get what they need to work properly and we would feel very sick!
