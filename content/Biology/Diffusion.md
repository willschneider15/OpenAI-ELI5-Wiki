# Diffusion

Diffusion is the movement of stuff (molecules) from an area of high concentration to an area with low concentration. 

* Imagine you have a bag of candy with many different flavors inside. If you shake it, the candies will scatter and move around. The flavors will mix until each candy bag has an equal amount of each flavor. 

* The same thing happens when perfume is sprayed in a room. The scent will spread equally throughout the room even if there is no air conditioning. 

* In cells, diffusion is how nutrients and gases (like oxygen) are transported across cell membranes. Oxygen moves from the high concentration area (where it's breathed in) to the low concentration area (where it's needed by the cells). 

* Diffusion can also happen in liquids and gases. In water, small particles move around randomly and mix with other particles until they are evenly distributed. 

* Diffusion happens in many places like the kitchen, lab, and even in our bodies. It's a natural process that helps maintain balance, without which life would be impossible.
