# Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are like the "instruction manuals" of our bodies. They give our cells important directions for growth, development and functioning. 

* Nucleic acids are made up of smaller units called nucleotides that link together, forming long strands.
* There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).
* DNA is like the blueprint for our bodies, containing all the genetic information we inherit from our parents.
* RNA helps to carry out the instructions that DNA provides.
* Nucleic acids are essential for life - without them, our cells wouldn't be able to function properly and our bodies wouldn't be able to grow or develop.
