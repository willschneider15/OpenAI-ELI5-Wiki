# Immune System

The immune system is like the body's army. It helps to protect us from germs and other bad things that can make us sick. Here are some things that the immune system does:

- The immune system has special cells that help to fight off germs
- Think of these cells like little soldiers that go after the bad guys!
- These cells can also remember germs they've fought before, so if they come back again later, the immune system knows how to handle them
- The immune system can also make special liquids called antibodies that help to kill germs
- Sometimes the immune system gets sick too, and when that happens we might need to help it out with medicine or rest. 

Overall, the immune system is like our own personal army, ready to defend our body from anything that might try to harm it!
