# Endangered Species

Endangered Species are animals and plants that are in danger of dying out completely. This is really bad because every living thing has an important role to play in nature! Here are some important things to know about why species become endangered:

- *Habitat loss:* This is when a plant or animal loses its place to live, usually because people are cutting down forests, building cities or farms, or developing land for other uses. 
- *Overharvesting:* When people hunt or fish too much, it can make it hard for a species to survive.
- *Climate change:* Global warming and climate change can affect animals and plants differently, but it can cause changes in their environment that make it difficult for them to grow and live.
- *Pollution:* Pollution can harm animals and plants, especially if it gets into the water or air. 
- *Invasive species:* Invasive species are plants or animals (like a bug, for example) that come from somewhere else and can cause harm to the local plants and animals.

We need to work hard to protect endangered species by:

- Creating and protecting habitats
- Stopping overharvesting
- Reducing pollution 
- Controlling invasive species
- Educating others about the importance of protecting endangered species 

Let's work together to help protect our planet and all the amazing animals and plants that call it home!
