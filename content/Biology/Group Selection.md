# Group Selection

Group selection is like choosing a sports team. If you have a group of people who want to win, you need to choose the people who work well together to make the best team. In biology, this means that sometimes, groups of organisms work together to survive better than individuals who are just looking out for themselves. 

* In group selection, organisms within a group have to cooperate.
* When individuals work together, they can accomplish more than if they were working separately.
* This can help them survive and reproduce in their environment more effectively than if they acted selfishly.
* Some examples of group selection in the animal kingdom include bees working together in a hive and lions hunting together in a pack.
