# Digestion

**Digestion is the process by which our bodies break down the food we eat into smaller pieces that our bodies can use to stay healthy and strong.**

* When we eat food, our teeth start to break it down into small pieces.
* The saliva in our mouth helps to further break down the food and makes it easier to swallow.
* The food travels down our throat and into our stomach.
* In our stomach, the food is mixed with stomach acid and enzymes that break it down even more.
* After a few hours, the broke down food is moved to the small intestine, where most of the nutrients are absorbed.
* The leftover waste travels to the large intestine, where water is absorbed and the remaining waste is formed into feces.
* The feces are stored in the rectum until they are ready to be eliminated.
* The process of digestion is complete when we expel the solid waste from our bodies as poop.
