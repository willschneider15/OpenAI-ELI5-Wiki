# Dormancy

Dormancy is when a living thing (like a plant or seed) stops growing and developing for a while. It's kind of like taking a nap or a break. Here are some things to remember about dormancy:

- Dormancy happens when the conditions aren't right for growth and development.
- Some living things go dormant during the winter because it's too cold for them to grow.
- Others go dormant during the summer because it's too hot and dry for them to grow.
- Seeds can also go dormant until they get planted in the right kind of soil or until there's enough water or light for them to start growing.
- Dormancy is a way for living things to survive when conditions aren't good for growth and development.
- When conditions do become right for growth and development again, the living thing will "wake up" from dormancy and start growing again.

So, dormancy is like a rest period for living things when the conditions aren't right for growth and development.
