# Altruism

**Altruism:**

Altruism is when you do something nice for someone else without expecting anything in return. It's like when you help your friend with their math homework even though you don't like math because you want to make them happy.

* Altruism is about selflessly helping others.
* It's doing something good for someone without expecting anything back.
* Examples of altruism include donating money to charity or helping an elderly person cross the street.
* Altruistic behavior can improve social relationships within a group.
* Altruism is not the same as selfishness or acting in one's own interest.
