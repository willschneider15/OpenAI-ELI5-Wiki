# Community Ecology

Community ecology is a branch of biology that studies the interactions between all living things within an ecosystem. It looks at how different species, or groups of animals, plants, and other organisms, live in the same place and how they interact with each other.

* Community ecology studies how species interact with:

  - Each other
  - The physical environment (e.g., temperature, moisture, soil quality)
  - The resources available (e.g., food, water, habitat)

* It also looks at how different factors can affect the community:

  - Environmental influences (e.g., natural disasters, climate change)
  - Human actions (e.g., pollution, habitat destruction)

* Community ecology helps us understand:

  - Biodiversity (the variety of life on Earth)
  - How ecosystems work (e.g., nutrient cycling)
  
* By understanding community ecology, we can:

  - Better protect endangered species
  - Manage natural resources in a sustainable way
  - Predict the effects of environmental changes on ecosystems.
