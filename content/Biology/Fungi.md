# Fungi

**Fungi are living things that:**

- are found all around us - in the soil, the air, and even in our food!
- are different from plants and animals.
- can't make their own food like plants or move around like animals.
- are made up of tiny threads called "hyphae" that grow and spread out underground or through the things they are growing on.
- break down dead plants and animals, helping to recycle nutrients into the soil for new plants to grow.
- can also live on other living things - like us! - and cause infections, but most fungi are not harmful to humans.
- can be used to make things like beer, bread, and even medicine.

Overall, fungi are a diverse group of organisms that play important roles in the natural world, from breaking down organic matter to providing us with food and medicine.
