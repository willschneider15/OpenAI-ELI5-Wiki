# Oxidative Phosphorylation

Oxidative phosphorylation is the process that our cells use to make energy out of food. In simpler terms, it's the battery that keeps our body running. Here's how it works:

1. Our body breaks down food molecules into smaller pieces called glucose
2. These glucose molecules are broken down into a molecule called pyruvate in a process called glycolysis
3. Pyruvate then is transformed through a process called the Krebs cycle, which results in the production of molecules like NADH and FADH2
4. These molecules are then used to power the electron transport chain, where they give up their electrons
5. Electrons move along the transport chain while energy is extracted from them, resulting in the transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane
6. This creates a concentration gradient, which drives the production of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis

In summary, oxidative phosphorylation is a crucial process that our body uses to make energy to power vital cellular functions.
