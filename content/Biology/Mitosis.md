# Mitosis

Mitosis is a process in which cells make copies of themselves. Imagine that you have a toy car, and you want to make another one that looks exactly like it. You would need to follow several steps:

- Take apart the car into its different parts.
- Make a copy of each part.
- Put the new parts back together in the same way as the original car.

Cells do something similar during mitosis:

- They first duplicate their genetic material (DNA) so that each new cell will have the same exact genetic information as the original cell.
- They then divide their genetic material evenly into two sets and separate those sets into two identical nuclei.
- Finally, the cell membrane pinches together to separate the two nuclei into two separate cells, each with the same genetic material.

Overall, mitosis ensures that our body can grow, repair damaged tissues, and replace old cells with new ones that are genetically identical to the original cells.
