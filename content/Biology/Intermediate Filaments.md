# Intermediate Filaments

**Intermediate filaments** can be thought of as the "skeleton" of our cells. Our cells rely on these filaments for necessary support and stability so that they can maintain their shape and function properly.

Here are some key points to better understand intermediate filaments:

* Intermediate filaments are long, thin proteins that connect to form fibers.
* They are located within the cytoplasm of our cells, providing structural support for various cell types including muscle, skin, and nerve cells.
* Intermediate filaments are responsible for holding together the structure of our tissues, and help maintain the mechanical and electrical properties of our cells.
* These filaments are more permanent than other types of filaments in the cytoplasm of a cell, such as microfilaments and microtubules.
* There are several different types of intermediate filaments, each with their own specific function and location in the body. Some common examples include keratin, vimentin, and neurofilaments.

In summary, intermediate filaments play an important role in providing the structural support and stability necessary for our cells to function properly.
