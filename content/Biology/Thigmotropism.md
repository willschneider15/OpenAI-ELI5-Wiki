# Thigmotropism

Thigmotropism is a big word that describes how some plants grow towards things that they touch, like walls or stakes. This happens because certain parts of the plant (like the stem and leaves) can detect when they are being touched or rubbed, and they respond by growing in that direction. 

Here are some key things to know about thigmotropism: 

* The word "thigmotropism" comes from the Greek words "thigma" (meaning "touch") and "tropism" (meaning "turning").
* Thigmotropism is a type of tropism, which means any kind of plant growth or movement in response to a stimulus.
* Other types of tropism include phototropism (growing towards light) and gravitropism (growing towards or away from gravity).
* Thigmotropism is often seen in climbing plants, which use touch to help them find and latch onto supports as they grow upward.
* Some examples of plants that exhibit thigmotropism include ivy, grape vines, and morning glories.
 
Overall, thigmotropism is a cool way that plants can respond to their environment and find the support they need to grow and thrive.
