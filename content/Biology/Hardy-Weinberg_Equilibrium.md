# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) is a concept in population genetics that provides a mathematical model to predict the frequency of alleles in a population over time. It is based on five assumptions:

* No mutation
* No selection
* No migration
* No genetic drift
* Random mating

HWE can be used to determine if a population is evolving or if it is stable. If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, then the frequencies of alleles and genotypes will remain constant from one generation to another. This means that the genetic structure of the population remains the same over time.

The equation for HWE is p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Where p represents the frequency of one allele and q represents the frequency of the other allele in a population.

In summary, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium provides a framework for understanding how populations evolve or remain stable over time based on five assumptions, which include no mutation, selection, migration or genetic drift, and random mating. Through this concept, we can make predictions about the frequency of alleles and genotypes in a population.
