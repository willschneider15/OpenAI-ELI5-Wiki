# Macroevolution

Macroevolution is like playing with blocks. You start with one big block, and as you keep adding smaller blocks and changing their shape, you end up with a completely new structure.

* Macroevolution refers to big-picture changes in the history of life on Earth. 
* It refers to the evolution of different species and the changes that occurred over millions of years. 
* Just like building with blocks, each small change can add up to make something completely new. 
* For example, over time, small changes in the jaw bone of a reptile could lead to the development of the ear bone of a mammal. 
* These changes can result in the formation of completely different animals, like reptiles evolving into birds or primates into humans. 
* Macroevolution is a gradual process that can take millions of years for changes to be significant enough to lead to the development of new species. 
* Understanding macroevolution can help us understand the history and diversity of life on our planet.
