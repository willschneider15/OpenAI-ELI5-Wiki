# Symbiosis

- Symbiosis is like a friendship between two different living things.
- In this friendship, both living things help each other out.
- Imagine a bird cleaning the teeth of a crocodile. The bird gets food stuck in its teeth and the crocodile has dirty teeth. The bird gets food and the crocodile gets clean teeth, so they are both happy!
- There are three types of symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
- In mutualism, both living things benefit from their friendship.
- In commensalism, one living thing benefits from the friendship, but the other doesn't get hurt or helped.
- In parasitism, one living thing benefits from the friendship but the other gets hurt.
- These friendships happen all over the world, between all different types of living things. 
- Without these kinds of friendships, some living things might not be able to survive!
