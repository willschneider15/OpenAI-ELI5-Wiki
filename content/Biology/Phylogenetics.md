# Phylogenetics

Phylogenetics is a way of studying how living things are related to one another. It's like creating a family tree for all living things on Earth - from humans to plants to animals. 

* Scientists use a variety of tools to study the DNA and physical characteristics of different species. 
* By comparing those traits, they can determine how closely related species are to one another. 
* By looking at the entire family tree, they can learn about the history of life on Earth - how different species evolved and changed over time. 
* Phylogenetics can also help us understand the origins of different diseases, predict how species might respond to environmental changes, and inform conservation efforts. 

Think of it like this - every living thing on Earth is like a member of a big, extended family. Phylogenetics is the way we try to figure out who everyone's cousins, aunts, and uncles are!
