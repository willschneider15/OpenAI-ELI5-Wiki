# Prokaryotic Cells

A prokaryotic cell is a type of cell that is usually found in simple life forms like bacteria. 

Here are some key things to know:

- Prokaryotic cells don't have a nucleus, which is like the brain center of the cell
- Without a nucleus, the DNA in a prokaryotic cell floats around in the cytoplasm, which is the gooey substance inside the cell
- Prokaryotic cells usually have a cell membrane, which is like a flexible outer layer that separates the cell from its environment
- Many prokaryotic cells also have a cell wall, which is like a hard shell that gives the cell its shape and helps protect it from harm
- Other structures that can be found in a prokaryotic cell include flagella (like tiny tails that help the cells move), pili (like little hairs that help cells stick together), and ribosomes (which help make proteins)
- Prokaryotic cells can be found all over the world, in a wide variety of environments, from the depths of the ocean to the insides of your digestive system.

Overall, prokaryotic cells are simple but important building blocks of life, and understanding them is an important part of studying biology.
