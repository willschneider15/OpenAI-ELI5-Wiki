# Roots

- **Roots** are the part of a plant that grow underground.
- There are two types of roots: **tap roots** and **fibrous roots**.
  - **Tap roots** are thick and straight, growing deep into the soil.
  - **Fibrous roots** are thin and spread out in different directions, closer to the surface of the soil.
- Roots have many important functions:
  - They anchor the plant in the soil, keeping it from falling over.
  - They absorb water and nutrients from the soil, which the plant needs to grow.
  - They store food for the plant to use later.
- Roots can also grow in response to gravity and moisture.
  - The root will grow down toward the center of the earth, where it can find water and nutrients.
- Some roots can also grow aboveground and even climb on other plants. These are called **aerial roots**.
  - Examples of aerial roots include the roots of ivy and some types of orchids.
- Roots are important for all plants, helping them to survive and thrive in their environment!

**Additional Information:**

- Some plants can be grown from cuttings or root divisions.
- Many plants have roots that are used by humans for food or medicine. Examples include carrots, ginger, and ginseng.
- Roots can also be used to help prevent soil erosion.
