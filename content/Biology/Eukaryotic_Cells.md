# Eukaryotic Cells

* Eukaryotic cells are the building blocks of plants, animals, and fungi.
* They are different from bacteria because they have a nucleus that holds their DNA and other organelles.
* Organelles are like little organs inside a cell that help it function.
* Eukaryotic cells also have a membrane that surrounds them, which helps them maintain their shape and protects them from their environment.
* The membrane also allows things to pass in and out of the cell.
* Eukaryotic cells are much bigger and more complex than bacteria, which makes them capable of performing more complex functions.
* This complexity allows eukaryotes to grow and reproduce, as well as do specialized things like contract (in muscle cells), see (in eye cells), and make energy (in mitochondria).
