# Plant-Animal Interactions

Plants and animals have a complex relationship. 

* Plants are the primary producers in the food chain. 
* Herbivores, or animals that eat plants, are primary consumers that rely on plants for their food. 
  * Examples of herbivores include cows, deer, and rabbits. 
* Carnivores, or animals that eat other animals, are secondary consumers that rely on herbivores for their food. 
  * Examples of carnivores include lions, wolves, and eagles. 
* Omnivores, or animals that eat both plants and animals, are both primary and secondary consumers. 
  * Examples of omnivores include bears, humans, and raccoons. 

However, the relationship between plants and animals is not one-sided. 

* Plants may also benefit from animals. 
  * For example, bees help plants reproduce by carrying pollen from one plant to another. 
  * Birds and insects may also spread the seeds of plants. 
* Some animals may also help control pests that could harm the plants. 
  * Ladybugs, for example, are known to eat aphids, which can damage crops. 

In summary, the relationship between plants and animals is interconnected and vital for the survival of both.
