# Organelles

Organelles are like tiny factories inside of cells that help the cell carry out its functions. Cells are the building blocks of all living things, and they need organelles to do things like make energy, transport molecules, and get rid of waste. Some organelles that you might have heard of include:

* **Mitochondria** - These organelles are like power plants for the cell, and they use oxygen to make ATP, which is the cell's energy source.
* **Nucleus** - This is the control center of the cell, and it contains the cell's DNA, which is like a set of instructions for making proteins.
* **Endoplasmic Reticulum** - This organelle helps to transport molecules around the cell, and it has two types: rough and smooth.
* **Golgi Apparatus** - This organelle modifies and sorts molecules that come from the endoplasmic reticulum, and packages them up into vesicles that can be sent to other parts of the cell or outside of the cell.

There are many other organelles in cells, and they all have specific jobs to do. Without them, cells wouldn't be able to function properly!
