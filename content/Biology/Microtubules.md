# Microtubules

**Microtubules**

Microtubules are tiny structures that are part of the cytoskeleton of our cells. They are like the "skeleton" of the cell, providing shape, support, and transportation of molecules.

* Microtubules are cylindrical structures made up of proteins called tubulins.
* They are involved in intracellular transport, moving molecules and organelles from one part of the cell to another.
* Microtubules also play a role in cell division, forming the spindle fibers that pull the chromosomes apart during mitosis.
* They help maintain cell shape and provide structural support.
* Microtubules are also involved in ciliary and flagellar movement, allowing cells to move and propel substances across their surfaces

Microtubules are important in a wide range of biological processes and are involved in many diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Understanding microtubule function and regulation is essential to developing new treatments for these diseases.
