# Meiosis

**Meiosis** is like a special cell division that happens in our bodies to make eggs and sperm. 

- It is different from the regular cell division that makes more cells to help our body grow and heal.

- When a cell goes through meiosis, it makes four new cells that each have half of the number of chromosomes as the original cell.

- Chromosomes are what our genes are on and they control things like our eye color and hair type.

- When an egg and a sperm meet, they each give the baby half of its chromosomes so that it has the right number.

- This is why we look like our parents, but also have some things that are different, like our hair or eye colors. 

Meiosis is like a puzzle that needs to be put together just right so that our bodies can make healthy eggs and sperm that will help make healthy babies.
