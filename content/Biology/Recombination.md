# Recombination

Recombination is when pieces of DNA switch places with each other. 

* DNA is like an instruction manual for living things.
* Humans have over 20,000 genes in their DNA.
* Genes are sections of DNA that tell our bodies how to make proteins.
* Proteins are the building blocks for everything in our bodies.
* Sometimes when cells divide and make new DNA, pieces of DNA can switch places.
* This is called recombination.
* Recombination can create new combinations of genes that weren't there before.
* This can be good because it can create new traits that can help organisms survive.
* On the other hand, it can also be bad because it can create harmful mutations that can lead to diseases like cancer.
