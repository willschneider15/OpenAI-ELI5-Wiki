# Fertilization

Fertilization is when a sperm and an egg come together to make a baby! 

* An egg is a little cell inside a woman's body. 
* A sperm is a little cell inside a man's body. 
* When a man and a woman love each other very much, sometimes the sperm can swim into the woman's body and find the egg. 
* The sperm and egg then join together and start to grow into a baby. 
* This usually happens in a special place inside the woman's body called the uterus. 

That's how babies are made!
