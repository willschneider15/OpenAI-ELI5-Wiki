# Fermentation

Fermentation is like cooking food but for tiny things called microorganisms. Here is what happens during fermentation:

* Microorganisms eat up a type of food called glucose.
* They do this without needing oxygen (the air we breathe).
* As they eat, they make a chemical called lactic acid or alcohol.
* This chemical also lets them produce energy, just like how we get energy by eating food.
* Fermentation is used to make foods like yogurt, cheese, bread, beer, and wine.
* Fermentation is also used to produce chemicals like ethanol or acetic acid, which are used in industry.

In summary, fermentation is a type of chemical process that allows microorganisms to turn glucose into energy and create different useful chemicals.
