# Muscular System

The muscular system is like the engine of a car: it makes our body move and run. It is made up of all the muscles in our body, which are like rubber bands that can expand and contract. Here are some things to know about the muscular system:

- There are 600 muscles in the human body!
- Muscles are attached to bones by tendons, which work like rope to pull the bone when the muscle contracts. 
- There are three types of muscles: skeletal (which are attached to bones and help us move), smooth (which are found in organs like the stomach and move things through our body), and cardiac (which are found in the heart).
- Muscles need energy to work, and they get that energy from the food we eat.
- Exercise is very important for our muscular system because it helps keep our muscles strong and healthy.
