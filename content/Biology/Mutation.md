# Mutation

A mutation is a change in the genetic code that happens when cells don't copy the DNA sequence correctly. DNA is like a blueprint or recipe that tells cells how to grow and function. Mutations can be caused by many things, like radiation or chemicals in the environment. Mutations can occur in different ways, but the three primary types are substitution, deletion, and insertion.

- **Substitution** - when one letter (nucleotide) is replaced with another, it can sometimes have no effect or change the amino acid, which can lead to a different trait or disease.
- **Deletion** - when one letter is deleted, a different reading frame is established, causing frameshift mutations that cause premature stop codons, leading to incomplete or nonfunctional proteins.
- **Insertion** - when one letter is added, a different reading frame is established, causing frameshift mutations that cause premature stop codons, leading to incomplete or nonfunctional proteins.

Mutations can be harmful, beneficial, or neutral to an organism. Negatively affecting genes, such as cancer-causing mutations, can be passed on to offspring if it occurs in egg or sperm cells. Beneficial mutations, on the other hand, can improve the species' survival rates and lead to better adaptation to their environment. Neutral mutations often have no noticeable effect, but they are a significant source of genetic variation in a population, aiding evolution by providing the raw material for natural selection.
