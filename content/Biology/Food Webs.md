# Food Webs

A **food web** is like a big game of "who eats who" in nature. Here's how it works:

* Every animal needs food to survive, whether it's a big lion or a tiny insect.
* Plants are the base of the food web. They make food through a process called photosynthesis by using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
* Herbivores (plant-eaters) like rabbits and cows then eat the plants.
* Carnivores (meat-eaters) like lions and wolves eat the herbivores.
* Omnivores (both plant and meat-eaters) like humans and bears can eat both plants and animals.
* Decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down dead plants and animals to help recycle nutrients back into the soil for plants to use again.

Food webs are important because they show the flow of energy and nutrients through an ecosystem. Without them, animals and plants would not be able to get the nutrients they need to survive. As you can see, everything is connected in nature!
