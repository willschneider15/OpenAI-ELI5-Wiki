# DNA Replication

- DNA replication is a process where a cell makes a copy of its DNA so that when it divides, each new cell can have the same information.
- It happens in a part of the cell called the nucleus, and it needs a bunch of different things to work.
- Imagine you have a really cool Lego creation you want to share with your friends, but you only have one set of instructions. If you want to share it, you need to make a photocopy so you both can follow the same instructions. That's kind of what DNA replication is like - it makes a copy, so the cells have the same instructions to follow.
- The first thing that happens is that the DNA molecule unzips like a zipper, splitting the two strands apart.
- Then, each half of the original DNA molecule serves as a template to make a new, complementary strand. It's kind of like you have a piece of paper with a drawing on it, and you trace over it to make a copy on a different piece of paper.
- Once the new strands are complete, the cell zips the DNA molecule back up, so it's like it was before, but with two identical copies!
