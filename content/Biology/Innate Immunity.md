# Innate Immunity

Innate immunity refers to the defense mechanisms that a person is born with. These mechanisms work to prevent disease and protect the body from harmful pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. Rather than targeting specific pathogens, innate immunity provides a general defense against a wide variety of threats. 

Some key components of innate immunity include: 

- Physical barriers such as the skin, mucous membranes, and cilia in the respiratory tract which are the first line of defense against pathogens
- Chemical barriers such as stomach acid and enzymes that help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in the digestive system
- White blood cells called phagocytes which engulf and destroy invading pathogens 
- Inflammation which is a protective response that occurs when the body is injured or invaded by pathogens 

Overall, innate immunity plays a critical role in protecting the body from harm and allowing it to function properly.
