# Mutations

Mutations are changes that happen to the instructions (DNA) in our body. Some of these changes are like little errors that can happen when you're writing a word or drawing a picture, and they can happen for different reasons. Here are some things to know about mutations:

- Mutations can happen when our cells divide or when we're exposed to things like radiation or certain chemicals.
- Some mutations can be helpful, like when they make us resistant to certain diseases or allow us to see certain colors better.
- Some mutations can be harmful, like when they cause diseases or disorders.
- Sometimes mutations happen in parts of our DNA that don't have much of an impact, but other times they can change important instructions that control things like how our cells grow and divide.
- Mutations can happen randomly, but they can also be passed down from parents to their children.

Overall, mutations are a normal part of life, and they can have different effects depending on where they happen and what they change. While some mutations can have negative effects, others can actually be beneficial, even if they're not always easy to spot or predict.
