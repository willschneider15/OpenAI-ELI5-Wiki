# Cytoskeleton

The cytoskeleton is like the skeleton of a cell. Just like how our bones give our body shape and provide support, the cytoskeleton gives a cell its shape and helps it stay organized. Here are some important things to know about the cytoskeleton:

* It's made up of different types of protein fibers that work together to create a mesh-like structure throughout the cell. 
* The cytoskeleton also helps with movement by creating "roads" for organelles to travel on. 
* It's involved in a bunch of important cellular processes like cell division and signaling. 
* Different parts of the cytoskeleton have different functions. For example, microfilaments help with cell movement and division, while microtubules help with cell shape and transport. 
* Sometimes, the cytoskeleton can even change shape or move around depending on what the cell needs to do. 

Overall, the cytoskeleton is an essential part of a cell that helps it function properly and do everything it needs to do to keep us healthy.
