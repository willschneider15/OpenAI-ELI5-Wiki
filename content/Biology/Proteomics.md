# Proteomics

Proteomics is like a game of identifying all the players on a big team, but the team we are talking about is inside our bodies!

* It's a branch of biology that involves studying all the proteins present in a living organism.
* Proteins are like tiny machines that help our body function properly.
* Different proteins have different roles, like some help break down food, while others fight infections or carry oxygen to our cells.
* Proteomics helps scientists understand how these proteins work together to keep our bodies healthy.
* It also helps them identify proteins that might be causing diseases, so they can develop better treatments.
* Imagine you're trying to solve a puzzle, but you don't have all the pieces. Proteomics helps scientists find missing pieces so they can see the bigger picture of how our bodies work.
