# Facilitated Diffusion

Facilitated diffusion is a way that some substances move through the cell membrane. Imagine a queue at a door of a concert where only small objects (let's call them molecules) can fit through the door.

- This is how some substances enter our cells. 
- There are specific doorways in the cell membrane for these molecules, which are called transport proteins. 
- Transport proteins help to move molecules across the membrane by creating a pathway that the molecule can follow. 
- This pathway allows the molecule to go from an area of high concentration to low concentration, without using energy (like a ball rolling down a hill). 

Facilitated diffusion is used for molecules that would normally have a hard time crossing the cell membrane, such as:

- Large molecules like sugars and amino acids
- Charged ions like sodium, potassium, and calcium.

Overall, facilitated diffusion is an important process for the survival of cells, as it allows necessary molecules to enter and exit the cell. 

**Important Points:**

- Facilitated diffusion is a way for substances to move across the cell membrane.
- Transport proteins create pathways that allow molecules to move across the membrane.
- Facilitated diffusion does not require energy.
- Facilitated diffusion is used for large molecules and charged ions that would normally have a hard time crossing the cell membrane.
