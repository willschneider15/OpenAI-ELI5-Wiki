# Nervous System

Here's a markdown file explaining the concept of Nervous System in simple words:

---

The **Nervous System** is a very important part of the body that helps us in sensing and reacting to different things around us. Here are some key points to understand what it does:

- The Nervous System is responsible for controlling and coordinating all bodily activities.
- It consists of two main parts: the brain and the spinal cord.
- The brain is like a control center that processes information and sends instructions to different parts of the body through nerves.
- The nerves are like wires that carry messages from the brain to different parts of the body and vice versa.
- The spinal cord is a long, thin tube of nerve tissue that runs from the brain to the lower back. It helps transmit messages between the brain and the rest of the body.
- Through the Nervous System, we can sense different things around us like touch, sound, sight, smell, and taste.
- It also helps us to react to different stimuli like moving away from a hot object, blinking when something flies close to our eyes, or running away from danger.

In summary, the Nervous System is like a communication network that helps our body to sense and respond to different things around us.
