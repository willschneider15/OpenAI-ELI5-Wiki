# Antibiotics

Antibiotics are like police officers for your body. 

* When there are bad germs in your body, like police, Antibiotics come to get rid of them.
* Antibiotics are like tiny soldiers that fight against the bad bacteria. 
* They keep us healthy and help us get better when we are sick.
* Sometimes we don't need them, but when we do, it's important to take them exactly as the doctor tells us to.
* It's also important to not overuse them so the bad bacteria don't become resistant and harder to fight in the future.
