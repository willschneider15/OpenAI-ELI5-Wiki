# Gene Therapy

**Gene Therapy** is a type of treatment that can help people who have certain diseases. Here's how it works:

First, doctors find a person's "bad" genes - these are genes that are causing the disease. Then, they either remove those genes or replace them with "good" genes that work correctly.

There are two main types of gene therapy:

- Removing or turning off bad genes: This is called "gene editing." Doctors use special tools to cut or change the bad genes in a person's body, so they don't cause problems anymore.
- Adding good genes: This is called "gene addition." Doctors put new, healthy genes into a person's body, so they can take over for the bad ones.

Gene therapy is still a new treatment, and scientists are still learning about it. Some people have been cured of their diseases using gene therapy, but it doesn't work for everyone yet.
