# Evolutionary Biology

Evolutionary Biology is how animals and plants change over time. 

* Animals and plants have DNA (like a set of instructions that tell them what to do)
* Sometimes, DNA changes a little bit by accident
* If the change is good for the animal or plant, they might have a better chance of surviving and reproducing
* If they reproduce, their children will have that same change in their DNA
* Over a long, long time, many small changes can make a big difference, like how dogs come in many sizes and shapes but all descended from wolves.
* Evolutionary biology helps us understand why life is so diverse, and why some species are more closely related than others.

In other words, species adapt to their environments in order to survive and pass on the best traits to their offspring. Over time, these small adaptations add up and can eventually lead to the creation of new species. This is what we call evolution.
