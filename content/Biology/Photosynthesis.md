# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is a process that helps plants, some bacteria, and algae make their own food. It's like cooking or baking, but for plants. Let me explain like you're 5.

What happens during photosynthesis?

* During photosynthesis, plants take in sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
* Sunlight is like a plant's food.
* Water comes from the roots and is like a plant's drink.
* Carbon dioxide is like air for the plant.
* All of these things go into the leaves.

What comes out of photosynthesis?

* When plants have all of these things, they can make their own food.
* This food is called glucose or sugar.
* Glucose is like a plant's candy or snack.

What do plants do with their food?

* Plants use their food to grow.
* They use it for energy.
* They can store it for later.

Photosynthesis helps keep plants healthy and alive. And when humans eat plants, we get a healthy snack too!
