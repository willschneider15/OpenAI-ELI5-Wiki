# Synaptic Transmission

Synaptic transmission is when tiny messages are sent between nerve cells in your brain. It's kind of like sending a text message, but instead of using your phone, your brain uses chemicals called neurotransmitters. Here's how it works:

* Your brain is made up of billions of nerve cells called neurons.
* Each neuron has a little part called a "synapse" that can send messages to other neurons.
* When a message needs to be sent, the neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synapse.
* The neurotransmitters float across the synapse and attach to receptors on the next neuron.
* This connection causes the next neuron to either "fire" (send its own message) or "not fire" (ignore the message).
* The process repeats over and over, allowing your brain to send messages quickly and efficiently.

So basically, synaptic transmission is like a bunch of tiny messengers running around your brain, delivering important messages to keep everything working properly!
