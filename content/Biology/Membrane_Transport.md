# Membrane Transport

All living things, including plants and animals, are made up of tiny units called cells. Each cell is surrounded by a cell membrane which separates its insides from the outside environment. Membrane transport is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane. There are two forms of membrane transport; passive and active.

**Passive Transport**

Passive transport is like sliding down a slide without needing to put in any extra effort, so you don't need any energy. There are two types of passive transport:
* **Diffusion**, which is the movement of molecules from a higher concentration to a lower concentration. Diffusion is how oxygen enters your blood and carbon dioxide leaves.
* **Osmosis**, which is the movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane from an area with less solute (dissolved substance) to more solute. Osmosis is how plants get water from the soil.

**Active Transport**

Active transport is like climbing up a slide, it requires extra energy. Active transport is important when you need to move molecules against their concentration gradient, from a lower to a higher concentration. Active transport requires energy from the cell to pump the molecules across the membrane.
