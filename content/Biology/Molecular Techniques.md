# Molecular Techniques

Molecular techniques involve the study of molecules such as DNA and RNA which carry genetic information within cells. Scientists use these techniques to better understand how cells work and to diagnose diseases. Here's a quick rundown for a 5-year-old:

* Cells are tiny little things inside our bodies.
* They have parts called molecules which tell them what to do.
* One type of molecule is called DNA and it has all our genes in it.
* Genes are like recipes that tell our cells what to do.
* Scientists can use special tools to study DNA and figure out what genes are inside it.
* They can also use these tools to see if there are any mistakes in the DNA that could cause problems with how our cells work.
* This helps doctors figure out what's wrong with people who are sick and how to treat them.
