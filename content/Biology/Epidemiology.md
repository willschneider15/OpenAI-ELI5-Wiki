# Epidemiology

**Epidemiology**

- Epidemiology is like being a detective, but for diseases
- Instead of solving crimes, epidemiologists study diseases and try to figure out how they spread and how to prevent them
- They look at patterns of diseases in groups of people to see if there are any similarities
- Epidemiologists also try to figure out who is more likely to get sick and why
- They use their findings to create strategies to control and prevent the spread of disease
- They work in public health and use information from around the world to help protect people from outbreaks of disease. 

In summary, Epidemiology is a field of biology that's all about trying to figure out how diseases spread and how to stop them from spreading. It's like being a detective, but for health!
