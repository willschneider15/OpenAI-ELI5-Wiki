# DNA Sequencing

**What is DNA Sequencing?**

* DNA Sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotides (A-T-C-G) in a molecule of DNA.

**Why is DNA Sequencing important?**

* DNA Sequencing helps us understand the genetic makeup of organisms, including humans.
* It allows us to identify genetic mutations that cause diseases and to develop treatments.
* It helps in the field of forensics by allowing us to identify suspects through DNA evidence.

**How is DNA Sequencing done?**

* There are different methods of DNA Sequencing, but the most common is called Sanger Sequencing.
* In Sanger Sequencing, a DNA strand is copied many times to create fragments of varying lengths.
* These fragments are placed in a gel and exposed to chemicals that disrupt their structure in a way that creates a visible pattern.
* The pattern is read and used to determine the order of nucleotides.

**What are some applications of DNA Sequencing?**

* Personalized medicine
* Cancer research
* Agriculture
* Biotechnology
* Evolutionary biology
* Some common DNA Sequencing techniques are PCR, NG Sequencing, and SMRT sequencing.
