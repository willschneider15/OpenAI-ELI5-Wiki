# Flowers

Flowers are the colorful and beautiful parts of a plant that make people happy. They come in different colors, shapes, and sizes, making them very special! 

- Flowers produce seeds which are used to grow new plants.
- They have different parts - some we can see and some we can't.
- The visible parts of a flower typically have a specific job:
  - Petals are usually bright and colorful, and attract bees and other insects that help the flower to reproduce.
  - The center of the flower, called the "pistil," is where the seeds are made.
  - The "stamen" is the male part, making pollen which fertilizes the female pistil.
  - Some flowers have a nice smell, which is designed to help attract bees and insects towards them. 
- Some popular flowers are:
  - Roses
  - Sunflowers
  - Daisies
  - Tulips
  - Orchids
  
Overall, flowers are amazing and play a very important role in nature!
