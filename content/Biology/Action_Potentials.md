# Action Potentials

Action Potentials are how the brain communicates with the body. When you want to move your arm, your brain sends electrical signals to your muscles telling them to move. These signals are called Action Potentials. Here's how it works:

- Your brain sends an electrical signal down a long, skinny tube called an axon.
- This signal causes a bunch of special molecules called ions to move in and out of the axon.
- When the right ions are in the right places, the signal jumps to the next section of the axon and keeps moving down the line.
- When the signal reaches the end of the axon, it tells another set of molecules to release chemicals called neurotransmitters.
- These neurotransmitters tell the muscles (or other nerves) what to do.

All of this happens very quickly (like, in a fraction of a second), so you don't even notice it's happening. But without Action Potentials, your brain wouldn't be able to control your body.
