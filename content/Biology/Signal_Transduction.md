# Signal Transduction

Signal transduction is the way cells talk to each other. Just like the way your best friend calls you on your phone and tells you something important. Only in the case of the cells they don't talk, they send messages in the form of chemical signals. The cell that receives the chemical signal picks it up and sends another chemical signal to the cell next to it. And so on until the signal reaches its destination.

When a cell receives this chemical signal, it sends a message to its organelles to turn on or off certain functions. 

The signal transduction pathway can be broken down into three parts:
- Reception: The first step where the cell receives a signal
- Transduction: The second step where the signal is converted into a form that the cell can use
- Response: The final step where the cell responds to the signal

Signal transduction is critical in helping the human body respond to various stimuli, such as touch, smell, and sound.
