# Adaptive Immunity

Adaptive Immunity is your body's way of fighting off germs and other invaders that could make you sick. Here's how it works:

* Your body is really smart and has a memory. When a germ or invader enters your body, your body "learns" what it looks like.
* Your body can make special cells and proteins that can "remember" that germ or invader. These cells and proteins are called antibodies.
* If that same germ or invader comes back again, your body already knows what it looks like and can quickly make more antibodies to fight it off. 
* This is why you usually only get certain illnesses like chickenpox or the flu once - your body remembers how to fight it off.

Adaptive Immunity is super important for keeping us healthy. It helps us fight off all kinds of things that could make us sick.
