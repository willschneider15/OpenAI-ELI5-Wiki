# Conservation

Conservation is when people protect and take care of the Earth so that living things can continue living happily. 

Here are some ways to think about conservation like I'm 5: 

- Conservation is like taking care of your pet. Just like you feed your pet and give it water, we take care of the Earth so that plants and animals have food and water too!
- Imagine if all the trees were cut down and plants couldn't grow anymore. Without plants, animals wouldn't have food so we take care of the trees by not cutting too many down so animals can still eat!
- Conservation is like recycling. When we recycle, we can use things over and over again so we don't have to use up more resources. This helps protect the Earth!
- People can also build special places like parks or nature reserves where animals can live safely. This is like making a special home for your pet!

Conservation is all about looking after the Earth so that plants and animals can live happily for many years to come!
