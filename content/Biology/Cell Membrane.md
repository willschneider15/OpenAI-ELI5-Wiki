# Cell Membrane

The cell membrane (also called plasma membrane) is like a gatekeeper of a house. It is a thin, flexible barrier made up of fat and protein molecules that surrounds and encloses all living cells. Here are some key points about the cell membrane:

* The cell membrane is crucial for the survival of a cell because it regulates what enters and leaves the cell.
* The membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, which is like a two-layered sandwich of fat molecules arranged with their water-loving heads facing outwards and their water-fearing tails facing inward.
* The membrane is studded with proteins that act as channels, pumps and receptors, and help with communication and transportation across the membrane.
* The membrane is selectively permeable, which means it only allows certain substances to pass through while blocking others. This ensures the cell maintains the right internal conditions.
* The membrane can also change its shape, like a flexible sheet, to engulf (endocytosis) or release (exocytosis) substances in and out of the cell.

In simpler terms, the cell membrane is like a border guard that protects the cell from harmful invaders while allowing helpful friends to come and go.
