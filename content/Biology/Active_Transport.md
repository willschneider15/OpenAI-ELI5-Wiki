# Active Transport

Active transport is a way for cells to move things around in their bodies by using energy. 

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Cells need to move things in and out of their bodies to stay healthy.
* Sometimes, cells need to move things from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration. This is called moving "uphill."
* Active transport is like a little machine that helps cells move things uphill. 

Here's how it works:

1. The cell uses ATP, an energy molecule, to power the active transport machine.
2. The machine grabs the molecule or ion and pulls it into the cell, against its concentration gradient.
3. The molecule or ion is brought into the cell and used for various purposes like producing energy, building structures, or eliminating waste. 

Some examples of active transport include:

* Moving glucose from the gut into your bloodstream so your body can use it for energy.
* Moving sodium ions out of your nerve cells so they can be used to send signals.
* Moving calcium ions out of muscle cells to relax the muscles after they've contracted. 

Active transport is an important process that keeps cells healthy and functioning properly.
