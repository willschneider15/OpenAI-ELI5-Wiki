# Proteins

Proteins are like building blocks in your body. They are made up of tiny parts called amino acids which link together to form long chains. These chains fold up into specific shapes which ultimately determine the function of the protein. 

- Proteins are incredibly important in your body and perform different jobs such as:
  - Enzymes: speed up chemical reactions 
  - Structural proteins: create the physical structure of cells and tissues 
  - Hormones: send messages throughout the body 
  - Antibodies: help fight infections 
- Your body can make some amino acids but others must come from the food you eat 
- Some foods that are high in protein include meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts 
- Protein deficiency can lead to slow growth, weakened muscles, and lower immune function 

So, proteins are the tiny building blocks that play crucial roles in our body functioning properly.
