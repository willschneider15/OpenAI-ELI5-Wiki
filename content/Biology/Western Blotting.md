# Western Blotting

A Western Blot is a type of experiment that allows scientists to detect and study specific proteins within a mixture. 

Here's how it works:

- First, proteins are separated by size using a technique called Gel Electrophoresis. 
- Next, the proteins are transferred from the gel onto a membrane. 
- The membrane is then exposed to a primary antibody that recognizes a specific protein of interest. 
- After washing away any unbound antibody, a secondary antibody is added that recognizes the primary antibody. 
- The secondary antibody is conjugated to a detection molecule (like a fluorescent dye or an enzyme) that will give a signal if it binds to the primary antibody. 
- The membrane is then washed again to remove any unbound secondary antibody, leaving only specific protein-antibody complexes attached to the membrane. 
- Finally, the detection molecule is activated, generating a signal that can be visualized on film or using specialized imaging equipment. 

This process allows researchers to determine whether a specific protein is present in a particular sample, and to quantify the level of expression (i.e. how much of the protein is present).
