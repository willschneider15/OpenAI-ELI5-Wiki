# Gene Expression

**Gene expression is how your body uses your DNA to make things like proteins, which help your body function properly.**

- DNA is like a recipe book for your body.
- Different genes in your DNA tell your body how and when to make different proteins.
- Proteins are like the building blocks that make up your body.
- They are used to make things like muscles, bones, and even enzymes that help with digestion.
- If you think of DNA like a recipe book, gene expression is like choosing which recipe to make and following the instructions to make it.
- Sometimes your body needs more of a certain protein so it will turn on the gene that produces that protein.
- Other times, your body will turn off a gene so it doesn't produce a certain protein.
