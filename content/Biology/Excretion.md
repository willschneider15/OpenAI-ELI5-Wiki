# Excretion

Excretion is the way our body gets rid of waste. 

* Imagine your body as a house with a lot of rooms, and each room has a trash can. 
* Everything you eat and drink goes through your body, and when it is done being used, it gets thrown into one of the trash cans. 
* Your body needs to take out the trash regularly, which is what excretion is for. 
* One way that excretion happens is through the kidneys, which filter out the waste from your blood and turn it into urine. The urine then goes to your bladder until you go to the bathroom. 
* Another way your body excretes waste is through your skin, in the form of sweat. When you get hot or exercise, your body sweats to cool you down and get rid of waste. 
* Finally, your intestines get rid of solid waste through bowel movements. 

Excretion is an important process that keeps our body functioning properly and helps us stay healthy.
