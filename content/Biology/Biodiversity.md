# Biodiversity

*Biodiversity* is a big word that means all living things on Earth! 

- That includes plants, animals, and tiny things like bacteria.
- Everything on Earth is connected, kind of like a big puzzle! 
- Each piece of the puzzle, or each type of living thing, is important for a healthy and balanced environment.
- Biodiversity helps keep our Earth healthy and able to provide us with things like clean air, water, and food.
- This is why it's important to protect and preserve biodiversity, so we can continue to live healthy and happy lives! 

So remember, biodiversity is all living things, and keeping things balanced and healthy is super important!
