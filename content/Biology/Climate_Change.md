# Climate Change

Climate change is the change in the earth's climate caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere and cause the planet to get warmer. This causes different problems like:

* melting of glaciers
* rising sea levels
* extreme weather conditions like floods and droughts
* loss of biodiversity
* changes in the timing of seasonal events like flowering of plants
* acidification of oceans

It is important to stop climate change because it can have irreversible effects on the environment and the planet.
