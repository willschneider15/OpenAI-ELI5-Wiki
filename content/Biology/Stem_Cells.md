# Stem Cells

Stem cells are like magical cells that can become any type of cell in the body. 

* They are special cells that have the power to develop into many different types of cells, such as heart cells, muscle cells, skin cells or bone cells. 

* They are like body's own repair kit for the body. 

* They can renew themselves by dividing and making exact copies of themselves. 

* They can also divide and change into specialized cells that make up different tissues and organs in our body. 

* Stem cells are found in both embryos and adults.

* Embryonic stem cells are found in embryos that are just a few days old, but they have some ethical considerations associated with them.

* Adult stem cells are found in different organs and tissues throughout the body and don't have any ethical concerns associated with them.

* Scientists are very interested in studying stem cells because they could potentially be used to treat diseases and replace damaged cells in the body.
