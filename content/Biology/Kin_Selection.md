# Kin Selection

When we talk about kin selection, we're talking about how animals behave with their family members. Basically, animals will sometimes do things that help their relatives survive, even if it means putting themselves in danger. This is because they share some of the same genes with their family, so helping out their family members can also help their own genes survive.

Here are some key points to understand about kin selection:

- Kin selection evolved to explain why animals sometimes put themselves in danger to help their family members. 
- Kin selection is based on the idea that animals share genes with their family members. 
- When an animal helps out a family member, it's also helping out its own genes. 
- Animals are more likely to help out family members if they share more genes in common. 
- Kin selection can help explain why some animals live in groups and why some animals sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others in the group. 

So basically, kin selection helps us understand the ways that animals make decisions based on their family relationships. By helping out their family members, they can also help ensure their own genes survive and get passed on to future generations.
