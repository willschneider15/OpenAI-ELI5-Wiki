# While Loop

A while loop is a set of instructions that a computer follows over and over until a certain condition is met. Here's an example: 

* Imagine you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
* You have a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, two pieces of bread, and a knife. 
* You want to keep making sandwiches until you run out of either peanut butter or jelly. 
* So you start making a sandwich, and the computer starts following the instructions for making a sandwich. 
* When you finish making the sandwich, the computer checks to see if you still have both peanut butter and jelly. 
* If you do, the computer goes back to the beginning and makes another sandwich. 
* The loop keeps going until you run out of one ingredient or another. 

So the while loop repeats a set of instructions until a condition is no longer true. It's a way to make the computer do something over and over without having to write out each individual step every time.
