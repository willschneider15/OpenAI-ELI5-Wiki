# Pipelining

Pipelining is like a pizza assembly line! Each person in the assembly line is responsible for adding a different ingredient to the pizza, like sauce, cheese, toppings, etc. All of the workers are working at the same time, so as soon as one person finishes their task, the next person immediately starts their task. By the end of the assembly line, the pizza is fully assembled and ready to be cooked.

In computer science, pipelining is similar. A series of tasks or instructions are broken into smaller steps called pipeline stages. Each pipeline stage is responsible for a different part of the instruction or task. Just like with the pizza assembly line, each pipeline stage works on its part of the instruction or task in parallel with the other pipeline stages.

Pipelining is beneficial because:

- It increases instruction throughput
- It reduces overall execution time
- It allows for better use of system resources
- It is a key feature in modern CPUs to improve performance
