# Pipelining

Pipelining is a way of breaking down a complex process into smaller, simpler tasks. It's like an assembly line in a factory, where each worker does one part of the process and then passes it along to the next worker. In computing, this is done by breaking a complex task into smaller steps and then running each step in sequence. This way, each step can be completed quickly and efficiently, and the entire process can be completed more quickly than if each step was done all at once. Pipelining is often used in computer processors to speed up the execution of instructions.
