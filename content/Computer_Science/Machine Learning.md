# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a way for computers to learn without being programmed. It works by having the computer look at data and use it to learn. The computer looks for patterns in the data and uses them to make predictions and decisions. For example, if the computer looks at pictures of cats and dogs, it can learn to recognize which is which. It can then use this knowledge to identify cats and dogs in new pictures. Machine learning is used in many areas, such as self-driving cars and medical diagnoses.
