# Compiled

Compiled programming languages are like a chef cooking a meal. First, the chef collects all the ingredients (the code) needed for a particular dish. Then, they chop up each ingredient into smaller pieces (tokens). After that, they put the ingredients together in a certain order (syntax), just as a recipe tells you what steps to follow. Finally, the chef cooks and combines all the ingredients to make the final dish (a compiled executable file).

* Compiled languages, such as C++, are transformed into machine code before being executed.
* Compilation involves several stages, including preprocessing, tokenization, parsing, and code generation.
* Compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs, since they don't need to be translated at runtime.
* The output of compilation is an executable file that can be run independently of its source code. 
* Compiled programs have a longer build time, but a faster runtime than interpreted programs.
