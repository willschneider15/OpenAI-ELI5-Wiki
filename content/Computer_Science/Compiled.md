# Compiled

Compiled languages are computer languages that have been translated into a language that can be read by a computer. This process is called compilation. Compiled languages are different from interpreted languages, which are read line by line by the computer.

Compiling a program is like translating a book from one language to another. The compiler takes the program written in a high-level language and translates it into a low-level language that a computer can understand. This translation process makes the program run faster and more efficiently.

The compiler also checks the program for errors and warnings. If any errors are found, the compiler will alert the programmer and the programmer can fix the errors before the program is run.

Compiled languages are used in many different applications, from web development to game development. They are also used in embedded systems, where the code is written for a specific device or system.

Overall, compiled languages are more efficient and faster than interpreted languages and are used in a wide variety of applications.
