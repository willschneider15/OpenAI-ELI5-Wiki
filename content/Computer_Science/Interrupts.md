# Interrupts

**Interrupts** are like a traffic signal for computers. They are a mechanism that enables the computer to handle multiple tasks or events simultaneously. In simpler terms, interrupts are signals sent by different devices to inform the computer that they require its attention to complete a job.

Here is an analogy to help understand interrupts: 

Imagine you're reading a book and someone (a.k.a interrupt) calls out your name from outside. Your attention is diverted from the book, and you respond to the person outside. After finishing the conversation, you return to the book and pick up reading from where you left off.

Similarly, Interrupts function in a similar manner, and they allow the computer to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without disruption. Modern computer systems use interrupts to handle events and tasks such as keyboard presses, mouse movements or network transfers. 

Here are some key points to remember about Interrupts:

- Interrupts allow a computer to respond to external events by temporarily stopping what it is doing and switching to a different control flow.
- Interrupts can be triggered by hardware devices, software signals or exceptions.
- The CPU will save the current state of the task it was performing before handling the interrupt.
- Interruptions can be prioritized, ignored or disabled.
- Interrupt service routines (ISR) are the code that is executed when an interrupt occurs. They are responsible for handling the interruption and deciding what to do with the event.
- Interrupts have made computers more efficient by enabling them to handle multiple tasks at once.
