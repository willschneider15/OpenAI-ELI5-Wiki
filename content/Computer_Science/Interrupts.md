# Interrupts

Interrupts are signals sent from a device to the computer that it needs attention. They tell the computer to temporarily stop what it's doing and look at the device that sent the signal. 

Interrupts can come from devices like keyboards, mice, and printers. When the computer receives the signal, it stops what it's doing and looks at the device that sent the signal. The computer then decides what to do with the signal. It may tell the device to do something, or it may ignore the signal.

Interrupts are important because they help the computer respond quickly to devices that need attention. Without interrupts, the computer would have to constantly check all the devices connected to it to see if they need attention. This would slow down the computer's performance.

Interrupts help keep computers running smoothly and efficiently.
