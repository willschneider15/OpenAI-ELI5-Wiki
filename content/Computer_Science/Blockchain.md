# Blockchain

Blockchain is a digital ledger that stores information. It's like a database, but instead of being stored in one place, it is spread across many computers. Every time a transaction is made, a "block" is added to the chain. Each block contains a record of the transaction, like who sent and received it, and when it happened. All of the blocks are linked together, forming a chain. This chain can't be changed, so it's secure and reliable. Blockchain is used in many different fields, from banking to healthcare, to keep records safe and secure.
