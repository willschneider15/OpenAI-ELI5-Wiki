# Blockchain

**Blockchain** is like a digital book where you can write down things in a way that can't be easily changed or erased by anyone else. 

* It's like writing something down in permanent marker instead of pencil. 
* Every time you add something to the book, everyone who has a copy of the book will get that same update at the same time. 
* This makes it very hard for someone to cheat or change what's already been written. 
* It's really important for things like money or important documents because it makes them much more secure. 
* People all over the world can use Blockchain to keep track of things and make sure that nothing gets changed or lost. 

Overall, think of a Blockchain as a special book that everyone can see and no one can change without everyone else knowing!
