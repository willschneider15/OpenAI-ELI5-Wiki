# Binary

Binary is a way to represent numbers using only two digits: 0 and 1. We use this system in computers because they use switches that can only be off (0) or on (1). When we count in binary, we use a different pattern than counting in decimal (the system we normally use with 10 digits). Let's break this down:

* In decimal, we use powers of 10 to represent the value of different positions in a number. In binary, we use powers of 2.
* In a binary number, the position of each digit represents a different power of 2.
* The rightmost digit represents 2^0 (which is 1), the next one to the left 2^1 (which is 2), then 2^2 (which is 4), and so on.
* Each digit in a binary number can only be 0 or 1. When a digit is 1, you add the corresponding power of two to the total. When it's 0, you don't add anything.
* To convert a decimal number to binary, we can divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders until we get to 0.
* To convert a binary number to decimal, we can add up the values of each position based on whether it's a 0 or 1.
