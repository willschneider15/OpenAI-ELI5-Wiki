# Binary

Binary is a way for computers to understand numbers and information. It works by using two symbols: 0 and 1. These symbols are called bits and each bit has a value of either 0 or 1. Computers use these bits to represent numbers and information. For example, if a computer has 8 bits, it can represent any number from 0 to 255. This is because each bit can be either 0 or 1, so the combinations of 0s and 1s can represent any number from 0 to 255. Binary is used by computers to store and process information. It is the language that computers use to understand what we tell them.
