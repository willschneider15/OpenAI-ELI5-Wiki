# Queue

A **queue** is like a line of people waiting for the bus. Just like how people form a line for the bus, computers also need to form a line for processing information. 

* A `queue` is a type of data structure where the order of data added is preserved.
* The first data item added to the queue is always the first one to be removed.
* Just like how people join the back of the bus line and leave from the front, data is added to the back of a queue and removed from the front.
* When new data is added to the queue, it gets added to the end of the line.
* When data is removed from the queue, the first data added is the first to get removed.
* A queue is commonly used in computer programs when we need to maintain the order of data being processed such as printing jobs, requests for a server, or handling network packets.
* Famous examples include the waitlist for tickets of movies or any online event.
