# Queue

A queue is like a line of people waiting to get something done. When someone joins the line, they go to the end and wait their turn. When it's their turn, they move to the front of the line and get what they need. 

In computer science, a queue is a collection of objects that are stored in a specific order. Objects are added to the end of the queue, and removed from the front. This is known as a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) system. 

Queues are often used to store tasks that need to be done in order. For example, if you have a program that needs to print a bunch of documents, it can put the documents into a queue and print them one at a time. 

Queues are also used to handle requests from multiple sources. For example, if you have a website that gets a lot of visitors, it can put the requests into a queue and process them one at a time. 

Queues are a great way to make sure that tasks are completed in the right order, and that requests are handled quickly and efficiently.
