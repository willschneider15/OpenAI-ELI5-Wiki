# Conditional Logic

Conditional logic is like a decision-making process for a computer. It helps the computer to perform different actions based on certain conditions. Think of it like the "if-then" statements that we use in our daily lives.

Here are a few key points to keep in mind when understanding conditional logic:

- Conditional logic uses "if-then" statements. 
- There are two parts to the statement: the condition and the action that follows. 
- A "true" condition will result in the corresponding action being executed. 
- A "false" condition will not execute that action. 
- The computer can also perform other actions if the conditions are not met.

Conditional logic is a fundamental concept in Computer Science and is used in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++. Developers use conditional logic to create complex programs that can respond to user input and perform a variety of tasks. Understanding conditional logic is essential to programming and can help you build more robust software.
