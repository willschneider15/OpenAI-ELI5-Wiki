# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of computer program that works similarly to the human brain. Like the human brain, ANNs learn from experience and make decisions based on what they've learned. ANNs consist of layers of interconnected "neurons," which are mathematical functions that take input and produce output. These neurons are organized into input, hidden, and output layers. 

Here's how ANNs work: 

1. **Input layer:** The input layer receives data that ANNs will analyze.
2. **Hidden layer:** The input layer is connected to one or more hidden layers, where computations occur. Each neuron in the hidden layer receives input from multiple neurons in the input layer, performs a calculation on the input, and sends the output to neurons in the next layer.
3. **Output layer:** The final layer is the output layer, which produces the result of the analysis. 

ANNs learn from input data by adjusting the strength of the connections between neurons in the hidden layer. By adjusting these connections, ANNs can learn to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on this recognition. 

Overall, ANNs are used for tasks such as image and voice recognition, language translation, and self-driving cars.
