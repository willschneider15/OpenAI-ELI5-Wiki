# Concurrency

Concurrency is like having many things happening at once. Imagine you have a lot of toys to play with. You can play with one toy at a time, but if you have a lot of toys, you can play with more than one toy at the same time. That's what concurrency is like. It's like having multiple tasks happening at the same time. This is important in computer science because it helps computers work faster and more efficiently. With concurrency, a computer can do more than one task at a time, so it can get more done in a shorter amount of time.
