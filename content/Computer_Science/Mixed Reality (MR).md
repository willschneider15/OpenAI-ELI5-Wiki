# Mixed Reality (MR)

Mixed Reality (MR) is a technology that combines virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). It is a type of technology that allows users to interact with virtual objects in the real world. MR allows users to experience a combination of physical and digital worlds. 

For example, a user can use an MR headset to view a virtual object in the real world. The user can then interact with the virtual object as if it were a real object. The user can move around the virtual object, interact with it, and even change its appearance. 

MR technology is used in many industries such as gaming, entertainment, education, and healthcare. It can be used to create immersive experiences and to provide users with a better understanding of their environment. MR can also be used to create interactive experiences and to help people understand complex concepts. 

MR technology is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving. In the future, it is expected to become even more advanced and to offer more immersive and interactive experiences.
