#### RFID: A tag that talks to computers!

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. It's a technology used to identify and track objects without touching them. Think of it like magic! It helps identify things like products in a store or books in a library.

- An RFID tag is a tiny computer chip with an antenna.
- This tag can be attached to objects.
- When the tag is awakened by radio waves from an RFID reader, it sends information back to the reader.
- The information on the tag is unique, just like your name.
- The reader can use this information to identify and track objects.
- The reader can also write information to the tag.
- This technology is used in all sorts of things, from tracking inventory in stores to monitoring medical equipment in hospitals.

So, next time you see a product in a store with an RFID tag, remember that it's talking to a computer!
