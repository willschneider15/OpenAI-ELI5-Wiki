# RFID

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. It is a technology that uses radio waves to identify and track objects. RFID tags are small chips that contain a unique serial number that can be used to identify an object. These tags are attached to objects and can be read using a RFID reader. The reader sends out a signal which is picked up by the tag and then the tag sends back its unique serial number. This number can then be used to identify the object. RFID is used in many different applications including inventory tracking, access control, and automatic payment systems.
