# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is like teaching a pet to do a trick, but for machines!

- Machines are given a task to do
- They try various ways to do the task
- When they do the task correctly, they are rewarded
- If they do the task incorrectly, they are told what they did wrong
- They try again with the feedback and do the task better
- Eventually, they get so good at the task that they can do it without any help from their teacher

Reinforcement learning is used to program machines to do things like play games or navigate through a maze. It's a popular technique in AI because it mimics the way humans learn. With enough practice and feedback, machines can become experts at tasks, just like humans!
