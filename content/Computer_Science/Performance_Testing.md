# Performance Testing

Performance testing helps to find out whether your computer program works fast and without errors. It's like a race that your program has to win. Here's how it works:

* You give your program some tasks to do
* You measure how fast it finishes these tasks
* You check if it works correctly
* If it meets the requirements and is fast enough, you're done!
* If not, you need to figure out what's wrong and make improvements

Imagine you're baking cookies. You have a recipe that tells you how long to bake them for, but you want to make sure the time is just right. So you set a timer and check the cookies when it goes off. If they're not done yet, you put them back in the oven for a bit longer. If they're overdone or not baked enough, you adjust the timer accordingly.

It's the same with performance testing! You set a goal for how long a program should take to complete a task. If it's too slow or too fast, you adjust and retest until it meets your requirements.
