# Void

Void is a concept in computer programming that refers to a lack of value or data. It can be thought of as an empty space or a place where no information exists.

When a program is running, it needs to be able to store and process data. When a variable is set to void, it means that it has no value and no data stored in it. This can be useful in certain situations, such as when a program needs to check if a variable has been set to a value or not.

Void can also be used to signify the end of a function. When a function ends, it can return a value, such as true or false, or it can return void to indicate that no value was returned.

In summary, void is a concept in computer programming that refers to a lack of value or data. It is often used to signify the end of a function or to indicate that a variable has no value.
