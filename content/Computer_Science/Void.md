# Void

Void is a special keyword in programming that has a very simple and specific meaning. You can think of it as a sort of "nothing" or "empty" value. Here are some key things to know about void:

- When a function is declared as void, it means that it does not return any value.
- This is different from functions that return a value, like a number or a string.
- Instead of returning a value, a void function might perform some action or modify some data.
- For example, a void function could print something to the screen, change the value of a variable, or even launch a rocket!
- Because void functions don't return a value, you don't typically use them in the same way as other functions.
- Instead, you might "call" a void function to perform some action, but you don't usually use its result for anything else.
- Overall, void is a simple concept, but an important one to understand in programming.
