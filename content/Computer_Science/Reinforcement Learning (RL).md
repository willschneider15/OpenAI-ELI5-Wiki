# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that teaches computers to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a reward. It works by having the computer take an action, receive a reward (positive or negative), and then use that information to adjust its behavior accordingly. For example, if the computer takes an action that leads to a positive reward, it will be more likely to take that action again in the future. The goal is for the computer to learn the best strategies for achieving the highest reward. RL can be used to solve complex problems such as playing a game, controlling a robot, or making financial decisions.
