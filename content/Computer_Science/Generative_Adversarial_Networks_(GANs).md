# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

A Generative Adversarial Network is like an artist and an art critic playing a fun game together. 

* The artist (Generator) draws pictures of things, like cats or houses. 
* The art critic (Discriminator) looks at the pictures and says whether they think itâ€™s a real picture or just something the artist made up.
* The artist then tries to improve their pictures to trick the art critic into thinking it's real
* After some time, the artist gets really good at making pictures that are so realistic, the critic can't tell if it's real or fake.

In computer science terms: 

* GANs are two neural networks that compete against each other to generate new data.
* The generator creates new examples that match the input data, while the discriminator tries to tell if the examples are real or fake. 
* The generator gets better at creating realistic data as the discriminator gets better at telling the difference between real and fake.
* This process can be used for things like image editing, text-to-image generation, and even creating deep fakes.
