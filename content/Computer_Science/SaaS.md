# SaaS

Software as a Service (SaaS) is like renting toys at a toy store. You don't have to buy the toy, take it home with you, and find a place to put it after you're done playing with it. Instead, you pay to use the toy in the store and then leave it behind when you're done. SaaS works the same way. Instead of buying and installing software on your own computer, you access it over the internet.
