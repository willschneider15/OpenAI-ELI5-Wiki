# Greedy

**Greedy** is a way of solving problems where we always choose the best option that is available to us at the moment. It means making decisions at each step that seem to be the best for the current situation without any consideration of the future but turns out to be optimal for the whole problem. It is a simple approach that is often used to solve optimization problems. To put it simply:

- Choose the best option available in the moment.
- Don't worry about what might happen in the future.
- Hope that the sum of these best options turns out to be the optimal solution.

Some examples where Greedy Algorithm can be applied are:

- Finding the shortest path from one city to another.
- Scheduling tasks to minimize completion time.
- Finding the minimum number of coins required to make change for a certain amount.

The greedy approach may not always give the optimal solution, but it can provide an approximation in many cases. It is essential to analyze the problem and understand the greedy approach's limitations before applying it.
