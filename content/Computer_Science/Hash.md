# Hash

Hashing is like a game of matching cards. Each card in the game has a unique picture or symbol on it. When you want to find a particular card, you remember the symbol on it and match it with the one on the back of the cards. Once you find the card, you can use the picture on the front to answer questions or perform specific tasks. Hashing is like this matching game.

In computer science, hash functions take data and generate a unique digital "fingerprint" or hash code based on the contents of the data. It takes input of any length and generates output of fixed length which represents that data. This unique code is what is used to identify and retrieve the data when needed.

Hashing is often used to store passwords or other sensitive data. Instead of storing the actual password, the hash of the password is stored. When a user enters their password, the system hashes it and compares it to the stored hash to see if they match. This way, even if someone gains access to the list of hashes, they can't easily reverse-engineer the original password from the hash.

Some important points to remember:

- Hash functions generate fixed-length, unique digital fingerprints of data.
- Hashing is used to store sensitive data securely.
- Hashing is like playing a matching game - you compare the digital fingerprints (hashes) to find the desired data.
