# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is when you teach a computer to do things by giving it lots of examples.

* Think of it like a baby learning to recognize different animals by looking at pictures in a book - the more pictures it sees, the better it gets at recognizing them.
* In the same way, the computer looks at lots of examples and learns to recognize patterns, making decisions based on those patterns.
* As it learns, the computer gets better and better at making accurate predictions or decisions.
* This can be used for lots of things like predicting if it will rain tomorrow or recognizing faces in photos.
* Machine learning is important because it allows computers to do things that would otherwise be too difficult or time-consuming for humans to do on their own.
