# URL

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is like a street address for websites. It tells your browser where to find the website you want to visit. It usually starts with `http://` or `https://` and then has a domain name (like `example.com`). After the domain name, there might be a path (like `/about`) that tells your browser to go to a specific page on the website. URLs can also contain extra information, like what language you want to view the page in, or what type of file you want to download.
