# URL

A URL is like a location address for finding things on the internet. 

* It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. 
* It is the address of a web page or resource on the internet.
* It includes a few different parts that help your computer know where to go find what you are looking for.
* The first part is called the protocol, like "http:" or "https:". 
* The second part is the domain name, which is the "www.whateveritcouldbe.com" part of the URL. 
* Sometimes, there is a path after the domain name that specifies which page to go to on that website. 
* For example, in the URL "https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+URL&oq=what+is+a+URL", the path is "/search" and the query is "?q=what+is+a+URL&oq=what+is+a+URL". 

Think of a URL like a set of directions to a treasure: it tells your computer how to get to the web page or resource you're looking for!
