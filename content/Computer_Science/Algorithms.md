# Algorithms

Algorithms are like recipes for computers. They are step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do. The instructions can be simple, like adding two numbers together, or more complicated, like sorting a list of names. Algorithms help computers solve problems quickly and accurately. They can be used to find the shortest path between two cities, or to create a picture on the screen. Algorithms are like a puzzle for computers to solve. They can be used to help us do things faster and better.
