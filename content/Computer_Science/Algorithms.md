# Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe for making cake. It's just a step-by-step instruction that tells you what to do to complete a task. Think about it as a set of rules that computers follow to solve problems. 

Here's an example of an algorithm:

### How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

1. Get two slices of bread
2. Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread
3. Spread jelly on the other slice of bread
4. Put the two slices of bread together 
5. Cut the sandwich in half (optional)

Just like making a sandwich, algorithms can be simple or complicated depending on what you're doing. They're commonly used to solve problems like sorting data, searching for items, or performing calculations. 

Algorithms need to have the following characteristics:
- Clear and unambiguous instructions that anyone can understand
- A definite stopping point 
- Ability to handle any possible input

Hope this helps you understand what an algorithm is!
