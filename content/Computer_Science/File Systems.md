# File Systems

A file system is a way of organizing files on a computer. It stores and organizes data so that it can be easily accessed and used. Files are stored in folders, and folders can be stored in other folders. Files can be sorted by name, type, size, or other criteria. When you open a file, the computer knows where it is stored and how to access it. File systems also keep track of who can access the files, and what they can do with them. File systems help keep your computer organized and make it easier to find the files you need.
