# Graph

A graph is a way of representing relationships between different objects. It is made up of points (also called nodes) and lines (also called edges) connecting the points.

Each point represents an object, like a person, place or thing. The lines connecting the points represent the relationships between them. For example, if two people are friends, there would be a line connecting their points.

Graphs can also be used to show how objects are connected to each other. For example, if you wanted to show how different cities are connected by roads, you could draw a graph with each city as a point and the roads as lines.

Graphs can also be used to show how objects are related to each other. For example, if you wanted to show the relationships between different countries, you could draw a graph with each country as a point and the relationships between them as lines.

Graphs are a great way to visualize relationships between objects. They can help us understand how different objects are related and how they are connected.
