# Graph

A **graph** is a type of chart that helps us show how things are connected. 

Imagine you have lots of toys, and you want to organize them. You can use a graph to show how your toys are related. For example, you might have a toy box, a toy car, a toy train, and a toy plane. 

- Your toy box is connected to all of the toys because it holds them all.
- The toy car and the toy plane are connected because both of them can fly.
- The toy train is connected to the toy car because they are both vehicles. 

In a graph, we call these connections **edges**. The toys themselves are called **vertices** or **nodes**. 

There are many types of graphs we can use to show different kinds of connections, and we can make them all sorts of different shapes. But the basic idea is that we use graphs to help us understand how things are related.
