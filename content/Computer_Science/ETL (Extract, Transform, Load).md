# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used to move data from one place to another. The process involves extracting data from a source, transforming it into a format that can be used by the target system, and then loading it into the target system.

The first step, Extract, involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, text files, and web services. The data is then stored in a staging area.

The second step, Transform, involves cleaning and transforming the data so that it can be used by the target system. This may include converting data types, removing duplicates, and formatting data.

The last step, Load, involves loading the data into the target system. This could be a database, a data warehouse, or any other system that needs the data.

Once the data has been extracted, transformed, and loaded, it can be used by the target system. ETL is a process used to move data from one place to another, making it easier to use and analyze.
