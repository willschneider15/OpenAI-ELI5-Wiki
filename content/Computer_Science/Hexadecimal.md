# Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is a way to represent numbers. It is a base-16 number system, which means it uses 16 different digits instead of the usual 10. The digits used in hexadecimal are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14, and F is 15. Hexadecimal is used in computers because it is shorter to write than regular numbers. For example, the number 255 in hexadecimal is FF. This makes it easier to write computer code.
