# Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is a numbering system that uses 16 digits instead of 10 digits like the decimal system we use to count things. Here's an explanation in simple terms:

* In the decimal system, we use the digits 0 to 9 to count things like bananas or pencils.
* In the hexadecimal system, we use the digits 0 to 9 to count like in decimal, but we also count using the letters A through F. So we count 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, and then we start over with 10, 11, 12, etc.
* Each digit in a hexadecimal number has a value based on its position, just like in decimal. The rightmost digit represents ones, the next digit to the left represents sixteens, the next represents 256s, etc.
* Hexadecimal is commonly used in computer science, especially in programming and digital design, because it makes it easier to represent large numbers in a compact form.
* Additionally, hexadecimal is more commonly used to express colors in web design since it is closer to how technology represents them.
