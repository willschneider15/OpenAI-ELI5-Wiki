# Kanban

Kanban is a system that can help you manage your work by visualizing it. 

### Here's how it works:

* Imagine you have a to-do list that never seems to get shorter. 
* With Kanban, you take each task off the list and put it on a card. 
* Then you place the card on a board with columns labeled "To Do," "Doing," and "Done." 
* You start by putting all your cards in the "To Do" column. 
* As you start working on a task, you move its card to the "Doing" column. 
* When you finish a task, you move its card to the "Done" column. 
* By doing this, you can see all of your tasks at once, and where you stand with them. 

Kanban can be used for managing personal tasks, team projects, or even work at a manufacturing plant. The key is to visualize the work, limit work in progress, and continuously improve.
