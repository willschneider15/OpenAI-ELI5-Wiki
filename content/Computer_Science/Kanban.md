# Kanban

Kanban is a system of visualizing work. It uses cards, columns, and boards to help organize tasks and keep track of progress. It is especially helpful for teams working on projects.

The cards represent tasks that need to be done. They are placed in columns, which represent the different stages of the project. For example, one column might be labeled "To Do" and another "In Progress". As the tasks are completed, they are moved to the next column.

The board allows everyone to quickly see what tasks need to be done and what progress has been made. It also helps to keep everyone on the same page and makes sure that no tasks are forgotten.

Kanban is a great way to stay organized and get projects done efficiently. It helps to keep everyone focused and on track.
