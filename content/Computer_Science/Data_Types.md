# Data Types

**What are Data Types?**

Data types are categories of values that tell your computer how to interpret and manipulate a particular piece of data. Essentially, data types tell the computer what kind of data it is dealing with and how to handle that data.

**Why are Data Types Important?**

Data types are important because they help to ensure that the computer processes data in the correct way. By defining the data type, you can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve the overall performance of the program.

**Common Data Types in Computer Science**

- `integer`: Represents whole numbers (e.g. -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.).
- `float`: Represents numbers with decimals (e.g. -1.5, 0.0, 3.14, etc.).
- `string`: Represents text (e.g. "hello world").
- `boolean`: Represents true or false values.
- `array`: Represents a collection of values of the same data type.
- `object`: Represents a collection of values that relate to each other (e.g. a person's name, age, and address).

**Conclusion**

Data types are an important concept in computer science because they help to ensure that the computer processes data correctly. Understanding the different types of data types and how to use them is an essential part of becoming a successful programmer.
