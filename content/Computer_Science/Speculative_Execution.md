# Speculative Execution

Speculative execution is like trying to guess the answer to a question before the person has finished asking it. When we run a program, the computer tries to guess what the program will need next and starts doing that before it's actually needed. 

It's like cooking dinner - we start preparing things we know we'll need soon, like heating up the oven or boiling water, even if we haven't gotten to the part in the recipe that actually calls for those steps yet. 

* Speculative execution is when a computer tries to guess what a program will need next.
* It starts working on those things before they're actually needed.
* This helps speed up the program and make it run faster.
* It's like anticipating the next steps in a recipe before you get to them.
