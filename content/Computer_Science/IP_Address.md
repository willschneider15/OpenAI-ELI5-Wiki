# IP Address

An IP Address is like a home address for your computer when it is connected to the internet. Just like how your house has a unique address that helps people find it, your computer has a unique address that helps the internet find it.

* An IP Address is a series of numbers separated by periods (.) e.g. 192.168.0.1.
* It is assigned to each device that connects to the internet: computers, smartphones, tablets etc.
* An IP Address can be either dynamic or static. A dynamic IP Address is assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) each time the device connects to the internet, while static IP Addresses remain the same.
* IP Addresses are used to communicate with other devices connected to the internet, allowing them to share data and information.
* It is not synonymous with a website address (URL).
* An example of an IP Address is 172.16.254.1.
* There are millions of IP Addresses in the world because there are so many devices connected to the internet.
 
Remember, an IP Address is like a home address for your device on the internet.
