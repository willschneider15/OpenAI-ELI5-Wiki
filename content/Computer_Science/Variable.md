# Variable

Variables are like containers that hold different values, just like a box or jar can hold different things. In programming, variables have names (like "age" or "name") and can store different types of data, such as text or numbers. Here are some key things to note about variables:

* An example of a variable is `x = 7`. This assigns the value of 7 to the variable named `x`.
* The value of a variable can change as your program runs. For instance, you could later set `x = 10` and it would update the value stored in that variable.
* Variables can be used in mathematical equations or in conditional statements (such as `if` and `while` statements).
* When creating a variable, you need to specify its data type (e.g. `int` for integers or `str` for strings).
* Variables can be helpful for simplifying your code, as they allow you to store and reuse values throughout your program.

Overall, variables are like handy little storage containers that can hold different kinds of information you'll need in your program.
