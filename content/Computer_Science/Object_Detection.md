# Object Detection

Object detection involves training a machine learning model to identify particular objects in images or video. 
* Imagine you're playing a game where you have to find hidden items in a picture. Object detection is like that, but the computer plays the game instead of a person.
* The model looks at the pixels in an image and uses algorithms to identify shapes that could be objects.
* It then narrows down the possibilities by using what it already knows about those objects.
* Once the model has identified a certain object, it can also locate it in the image.
* Object detection is used in a variety of applications, from self-driving cars that identify other vehicles, to security cameras that detect intruders. 
* It's like having a superpower that can instantly spot and locate objects in images or videos.
