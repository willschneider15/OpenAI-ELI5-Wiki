# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Sure, I can explain Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in simple terms:

* A convolution is a mathematical operation where you take two functions and produce a third one that shows how one of them is modified by the other.

* In image processing, a convolution is used to extract features from the image by sliding a filter (a small matrix of numbers) over the image pixels and calculating a dot product at each position.

* CNNs take advantage of this idea by using multiple convolutional layers to build a hierarchy of features that can help identify objects within an image.

* Each convolutional layer has filters that learn by detecting various simple features, such as lines or edges, and these are combined in each subsequent layer to represent increasingly complex features, such as shapes and objects.

* CNNs also use pooling layers, which reduce the dimensions of the feature maps by down-sampling, preserving only the most relevant information.

* Finally, the output of the last convolution/pooling layers is fed into one or more fully connected layers, which perform a classification task based on the learned features.

To sum it up, CNNs are a type of neural network that use convolutions to extract features from an image, building a hierarchy of representations that allow for accurate classification.
