# Executable

An **executable** is a type of computer file that can be run on a computer. When you click on an executable file, it will start running and do whatever it was designed to do. 

* Executables are used for things like running applications, playing games, or executing specific commands. 
* They are often used to install software on a computer. 
* Executables are typically created by software developers using programming languages like C++, Java, or Python. 
* It is important to be careful when downloading executables from the internet, as they can potentially contain viruses or malware. 
* Executable files often have file extensions like .exe, .bat, .sh, .jar, or .py, depending on the programming language used to create them. 

Overall, an executable file is like a set of instructions that a computer can understand and follow to perform a specific task.
