# Executable

Executables are computer programs that can be run on a computer. They are files with instructions that tell the computer what to do. When an executable is run, the instructions are followed and the computer performs the tasks described in the file. 

Executables are like recipes. They tell the computer what ingredients to use and how to put them together to make something. Just like a recipe, the instructions in the executable must be followed exactly or the result will not be what was expected.

Executables can be written in many different programming languages, but they all have the same purpose: to tell the computer what to do. They can be used to create games, websites, and other applications.

Executables are a great way to make sure that a computer program will work the same way for everyone who uses it. They guarantee that the program will work the same way no matter what computer it is run on.
