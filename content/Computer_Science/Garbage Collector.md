# Garbage Collector

Garbage Collector is a program that helps keep your computer running smoothly. It does this by detecting and removing unnecessary or unwanted data from your computer. This data is often referred to as "garbage" because it is not needed for the computer to run properly. The Garbage Collector will look for files or programs that are no longer being used and delete them to free up space on your computer. It also looks for temporary files that are taking up space and clears them out. By doing this, the Garbage Collector helps your computer run faster and more efficiently.
