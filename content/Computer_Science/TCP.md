# TCP

Transmitting data over the internet is like sending letters. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) makes sure that the letters (data) get to the right place, in the right order, and that the receiver writes back to confirm that they got the letter.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- TCP is like a postman. It ensures that data is sent correctly from one device to another.

- TCP breaks data into "segments" (pieces) that can be easily sent over the internet.

- It numbers each segment so that they can be put back together in the correct order.

- TCP checks to make sure the segments are received by the other device. If something goes wrong, it will send the segment again.

- TCP waits for confirmation from the other device to make sure they got the data safely.

- If the data wasn't transmitted safely or the confirmation wasn't received, TCP will take action to try and fix the problem.

Overall, TCP is the backbone of the internet, ensuring that data is sent and received correctly so that we can browse the web, check our email, and do many other things online.
