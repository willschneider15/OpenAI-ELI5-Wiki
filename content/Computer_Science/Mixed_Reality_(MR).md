# Mixed Reality (MR)

Mixed Reality (MR) is a new kind of technology that combines the real world with the digital world. 

- Imagine you are looking at a book on your table, but suddenly, virtual objects appear on and around the book. That is mixed reality!
- MR is different from just looking at a screen because virtual objects are integrated into your physical environment.
- It is like a combination of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). 
- It uses cameras, sensors, and special glasses to make this virtual world blend with our world. 
- In MR, you can interact with these virtual objects just like you would with real objects. You can move them, resize them, and even interact with them. 
- MR has many applications in different fields, such as gaming, education, tourism, and art. It can be used to create immersive experiences, simulate environments, and enhance learning. 

In summary, MR is a new technology that creates a mixed world of both the physical and virtual environment, helping people to interact with the virtual world around them.
