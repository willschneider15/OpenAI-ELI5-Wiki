# Bare Metal

**Bare Metal**

Bare metal is the concept of running a computer system or server directly on the hardware, without an operating system or any other software layer in between.

* Here's an example: imagine building a house without constructing any walls or installing a roof, and just having all the electrical wires and plumbing exposed.

* In the same way, a server running on bare metal doesn't have any operating system or virtualization layer, so it can directly access the hardware components like the CPU, memory, and storage.

* The advantage of running on bare metal is that it provides faster access to resources and can achieve high performance levels.

* Bare metal is often used in industries that require high performance computing, such as financial services, scientific research, and high-end gaming.

* However, bare metal also requires more expertise to manage, since the lack of an operating system means that all configuration, drivers, and management must be conducted manually.

* Bare metal can also be more expensive than running on a virtual or cloud platform, since the hardware has to be purchased and managed separately.
