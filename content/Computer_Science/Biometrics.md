# Biometrics

Biometrics is like having your computer recognize you by your body instead of a password. You know how your mommy and daddy can recognize you by seeing your face? That's what biometrics does but for computers.

Here are some examples of biometrics:

* Your computer can recognize your face using a special camera.
* Your phone can unlock when it recognizes your fingerprint.
* Some buildings use your eye or your handprint to open the door.

Biometrics helps keep your computer, phone, or other things safe because only you can unlock them. It's like having a special secret that only you and your computer know.
