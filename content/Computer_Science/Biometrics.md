# Biometrics

Biometrics is a way to identify people using their physical characteristics, like their fingerprints, face, or voice. It is like a password that only you have. It is used to make sure that only the right people can access a computer, a building, or other secure areas. 

To use biometrics, a person must first give a sample of their physical characteristic, such as a fingerprint. This sample is then stored in a computer. When the person wants to access the secure area, they must give their sample again. The computer compares the new sample to the stored sample and if they match, the person is allowed access. 

Biometrics is a secure way to make sure that only the right people can access certain areas. It is becoming more popular as a way to protect important information.
