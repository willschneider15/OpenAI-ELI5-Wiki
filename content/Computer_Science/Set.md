# Set

A **Set** is a group of things that are all related in some way. Let us take an example of toys. You have a set of toys if you have more than one toy. A set is more specific when everything in the set has something in common. For instance, if you have toys that are all red, you form a set of toys with the color red. Here are few more things to keep in mind:

* The things in a set are called **elements**.
* The sets are defined by its elements. Two sets have the same elements if and only if they are equal.
* If a set contains no elements at all we call it the **empty set**.
* In a set, the order of elements does not matter.
* An element can be in a set only once, no duplicates.
* Sets can be combined with other sets using operations like **union** and **intersection**. 

In programming, sets are used to solve problems when we need to store a collection of items and quickly test for the existence of an element in it.
