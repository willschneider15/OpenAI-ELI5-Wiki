# Set

A set is a collection of items, similar to a box filled with different objects. Each item in the set is unique and can't be repeated. Sets are often used in mathematics to help solve problems. 

For example, if you wanted to know what items were in a box, you could create a set of all the items in the box. Each item would be unique and you wouldn't have any duplicates. You could then use the set to answer questions like, “What items are in the box?” or “How many items are in the box?” 

Sets can also be used to compare two collections of items. For example, if you had two boxes filled with different items, you could create two sets of the items in each box and then compare them to see what items were in both boxes. 

Sets can also be used to group items together. For example, if you wanted to group fruits together, you could create a set of all the different types of fruits. 

In summary, a set is a collection of unique items that can be used to answer questions, compare collections, and group items together.
