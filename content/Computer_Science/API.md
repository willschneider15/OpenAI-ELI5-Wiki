# API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of tools used by software developers to help create programs. It provides a way for different programs to communicate with each other and share information.

Think of it like a bridge between two programs. One program can send data to the other program using the API. The other program can then use the data to do something useful.

For example, a weather app can use an API to get the current temperature from a weather website. The app can then display the temperature on the user's phone.

In summary, an API is a set of tools that allows software developers to create programs that can communicate and share data with each other.
