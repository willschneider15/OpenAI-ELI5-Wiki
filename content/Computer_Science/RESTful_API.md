# RESTful API

RESTful API is like a pizza delivery service:

* You have a pizza shop that can make different types of pizzas.
* A customer (the client) can call the pizza shop and ask for a specific pizza (the resource).
* The pizza shop (the server) will make the pizza and box it up (the response).
* The customer can choose to eat the pizza or save it for later (store or manipulate the resource).

In computer terms, RESTful API is a way for two different software applications to communicate with each other:

* One software application (the client) sends a request for a specific resource to another software application (the server).
* The server retrieves the resource and sends it back to the client as a response.
* The client can choose to display or manipulate the resource.

The "REST" part of RESTful API means Representational State Transfer, which is a set of guidelines for creating web services that are:

* Stateless: the server doesn't store any information about the client between requests.
* Cacheable: the server can specify if a response can be stored and reused by the client.
* Layered: the client doesn't know or care if it's communicating directly with the server or with an intermediary. 

Just like how pizza delivery services have guidelines for ensuring that their pizzas are delivered fresh and hot!
