# Branch Prediction

Branch prediction is a technique used in computer architecture to help optimize the performance of a processor. It helps the processor anticipate which path a program will take and pre-fetch instructions accordingly. This helps the processor save time by making sure instructions are already in the pipeline when they are needed.

To do this, the processor uses a branch predictor. The branch predictor looks at the history of the program's instructions and tries to predict which instruction will be executed next. If the prediction is correct, the processor can pre-fetch instructions and save time. If the prediction is wrong, the processor will have to re-fetch the correct instructions.

Branch prediction helps the processor run faster by pre-fetching instructions. This helps the processor save time and run programs more efficiently.
