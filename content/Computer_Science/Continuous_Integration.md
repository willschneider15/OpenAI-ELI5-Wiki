# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a term used in software development. It means that as a programmer, we keep updating the software regularly. CI allows us to test the updated software for any errors as soon as possible, which helps in avoiding possible problems in the future. It is like making sure that everything is working properly, every time we make a change to the software.
 
Here are some points to understand better what CI is:
 
- When a programmer writes a code or makes changes to the existing code, it goes through a series of automated tests
- Through this continuous testing, any issues can be identified quickly and resolved before they create bigger problems
- CI is like having a security checkpoint for the code that ensures it's working correctly and minimizing errors
- The process involves testing the code for bugs, running it on multiple devices, checking for coding standards, and much more
- CI ensures that the code is progressing simultaneously without getting stuck in a single phase unnecessarily
 
Overall, CI is an essential practice in programming, making development faster and improving software quality.
