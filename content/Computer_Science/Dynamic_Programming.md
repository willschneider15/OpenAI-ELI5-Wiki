# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving a particular type of problem. Here's how it works:

Imagine you have a big problem that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. If you can solve each of those subproblems just once, and save their solutions, you can simply look up the solution every time you encounter the same subproblem. This is much faster than solving the same subproblem over and over again every time you need it.

- Dynamic programming is useful when you need to solve a problem that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
- If you can solve each of those subproblems just once, and save their solutions, you can avoid solving the same subproblem repeatedly.
- This saves time because you donâ€™t need to solve the same subproblem more than once.
- Dynamic programming is typically used for optimization problems.
