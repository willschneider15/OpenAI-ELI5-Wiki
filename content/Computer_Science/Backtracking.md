# Backtracking

Backtracking is like playing a game of Hot and Cold, where you have to guess a hidden object. It's a technique used in programming to solve problems by trying different solutions and going back or "backtracking" when it hits a dead end or incorrect solution. If you hit a dead end, you proceed to the previous step and try a different solution, until you find the correct one.

This technique follows four basic steps:

1. Choose an option: At each stage of the process, you need to choose an option or path to follow to solve the problem. 
2. Assess the consequences: After you choose a path, you need to assess whether it leads to a correct solution or not.
3. If it leads to the correct solution, youâ€™re done! Otherwise, try another option.
4. Backtrack: If none of the options lead to the correct solution, backtrack to the previous step and try again.

Backtracking is widely used to solve problems such as permutation, knapsack problems, and Sudoku.

In summary, backtracking is a problem-solving technique that involves trying different solutions until the correct one is found, and if the solution does not work, it goes back to the previous step and tries a different solution until the wanted solution is finally found.
