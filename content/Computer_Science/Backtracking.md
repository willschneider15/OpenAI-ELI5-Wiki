# Backtracking

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used in computer science. It involves trying out different solutions to a problem, and if it doesn't work, going back and trying a different one. It's like a game of trial and error.

To use backtracking, you choose a starting point, and then try out different solutions until you find one that works. If it doesn't work, you go back to the starting point and try another solution. You keep doing this until you find a solution that works.

Backtracking is a useful tool for solving complex problems. It can help you save time and energy by trying out different solutions quickly. It can also help you find the most efficient solution to a problem.
