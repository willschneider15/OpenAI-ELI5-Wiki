# Operators

Operators are symbols we use in computer programs to help us do math and other things with numbers and data. They make the computer "operate" on the data, kind of like a calculator. 

There are different types of operators, including:

* Arithmetic operators - used for math like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing
     * `+` for adding 
     * `-` for subtracting
     * `*` for multiplying
     * `/` for dividing
     
* Comparison operators - used for comparisons like checking if two values are equal or one is greater than the other
     * `==` for checking if two values are equal
     * `>` for checking if one value is greater than another
     * `<` for checking if one value is less than another
     
* Logical operators - used for Boolean logic, which is like a way of saying "true" or "false"
     * `&&` for checking if both things are true
     * `||` for checking if either thing is true
     * `!` for checking if something is not true
     
Overall, operators help us do all kinds of things with data in our programs.
