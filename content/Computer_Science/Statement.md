# Statement

A statement in computer programming is like a sentence in a language such as English. A statement is a small unit of code that tells the computer what to do. A statement could be as simple as telling the computer to add two numbers together, or it could be more complicated like telling the computer to sort a list of numbers in a specific way.

Here are some things to remember about statements in programming:

* A statement typically ends with a semicolon (;).
* A statement can only do one thing at a time.
* A program is made up of many statements working together.
* Some statements are conditional, meaning they only execute if a certain condition is met (such as an "if" statement).

Overall, statements are a crucial part of computer programming, as they provide a way for a programmer to communicate with the computer and tell it what to do.
