# Symmetric-key Cryptography

Symmetric-key Cryptography is a type of encryption that uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data. The key is a secret code that only the sender and recipient know. When the sender wants to send a message, they use the key to encrypt the message. When the recipient receives the message, they use the same key to decrypt the message. This way, only the sender and recipient can read the message, and no one else can access it. Symmetric-key Cryptography is a great way to keep data secure and private.
