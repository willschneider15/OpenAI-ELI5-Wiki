# Memoization

Memoization is a way of remembering things. It is a way of storing information so that it can be quickly accessed later. It is like taking a picture of something you want to remember.

Memoization is used in computer science to help solve problems faster. It stores the results of a calculation so that it can be used again in the future. This way, the same calculations don't have to be done over and over again.

Memoization is useful because it saves time and energy. It can also be used to check if a problem has already been solved. This way, it can avoid doing the same calculations over and over again.

In short, memoization is a way of remembering things so that they can be quickly accessed later. It helps computer scientists solve problems faster and more efficiently.
