# Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is like having 2 locks on your diary:

* 1st lock: You have a lock on your diary that only you can open.  
* 2nd lock: You also have a special code or fingerprint that you need to enter to open your diary.

2FA is like having two different kinds of locks on your diary, each providing different security measures. This ensures that only you can open your diary and nobody else can snoop around it.

The same thing happens when logging in to your favorite app on your phone, computer, or other device using 2FA:

* 1st lock: You enter your username and password to unlock your account.
* 2nd lock: The app sends a special code to your phone, and you enter it along with your username and password to access your account.

2FA ensures that only you can log in to your account even if someone else knows your password. So, itâ€™s like having another lock on your online accounts that keep your personal information safe and secure.
