# Input and Output

Input and Output are extremely important concepts in computer science. They are the ways in which a computer communicates with the outside world. 

* Input is anything you give the computer to work with, such as commands or data to process. Examples of input devices include a keyboard and mouse.
* Output is the resulting response that the computer gives back, it can be anything from text on a screen, music or even printing out a document. Examples of output devices include a monitor, speakers, or a printer.

In simpler terms:
- Input is like giving the computer instructions by typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse.
- Output is like what the computer shows you back, such as pictures or text on the screen.

In computer terms, Input and Output are also known as I/O. Understanding how Input and Output works is the first step to becoming a great programmer as all programs, in one form or another, are built to receive input, process it, and give out output.
