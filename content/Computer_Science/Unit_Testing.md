# Unit Testing

Unit testing is like doing a spelling check for your code. When you write a sentence, you need to make sure you spelled all the words correctly. Similarly, when you write code, you need to make sure it works correctly. Unit testing helps you do that.

Here's how unit testing works:

- You write a small piece of code (a "unit") that does one thing.
- You also write a test for that code that checks if it does what you expect it to do.
- When you run the test, it tells you if the code works correctly or not.

Here's why unit testing is important:

- It helps you find bugs early, before they become big problems.
- It helps you make changes to your code safely, without breaking things that used to work.
- It helps you understand your code better, because you have to think about how it should work before you write the test.
