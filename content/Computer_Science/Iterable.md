# Iterable

Iterable is a way of looping through a set of items. It works like a list, where each item is numbered and can be accessed by its number. To use an iterable, you use a loop which will go through the list of items one by one. For example, if you had a list of numbers, you could use a loop to go through each number and add them up. Iterable is a great way to quickly go through a list of items without having to write out each item individually.
