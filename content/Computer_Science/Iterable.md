# Iterable

An object that can be looped over

- Iterable is an object that can be looped over, meaning that you can perform a recurring action on all of its elements or values
- Imagine having a box full of toys, where you want to check each toy and see if it has wheels
- In this scenario, the box of toys would be an iterable, and the action of checking if each toy has wheels would be the iteration
- Essentially, an iterable is a container that holds a group of items or values that can be accessed one at a time in a specific order
- An iterable could be a list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc.
- It is a fundamental concept in programming because it allows you to perform various operations on collections of data in a more efficient and organized way
- Some examples of operations that can be performed on iterables include filtering, sorting, mapping, and reducing
