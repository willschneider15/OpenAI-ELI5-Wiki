# Digital Certificates

**What are Digital Certificates?**

A digital certificate is like a digital ID or passport that helps to prove the identity of a website or a person. Digital certificates contain information about the identity of the owner, such as name, email address, and public key.  They provide a way for you to trust that the website or person you are interacting with is who they say they are.

**What are they used for?**

Digital certificates can be used for various purposes, including:

* Encrypting and decrypting sensitive information
* Authenticating a website or a person
* Ensuring integrity of data
* Establishing secure communication over the internet
* Signing digital documents
* Providing non-repudiation (a sender can't deny sending a message)

**How do they work?**

Digital certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CA) who act as a trusted third party. The CA verifies the identity of a website or a person and then issues a digital certificate. The certificate contains the owner's public key. When you interact with that website or person, your computer uses that public key to encrypt your data.

If the website or person you are interacting with has a valid digital certificate, your browser will show a padlock symbol, indicating that the connection is secure. If the certificate is invalid, your browser may show a warning message, indicating that the connection is not secure or may be compromised.

Digital certificates help to ensure that your online interactions are secure and private.
