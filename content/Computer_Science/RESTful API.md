# RESTful API

A RESTful API is a way of communicating over the internet. It stands for Representational State Transfer (REST). It is a way for two computers to talk to each other and exchange information.

When a computer sends a request to a RESTful API, it sends a request with a specific format. The API then responds with a response that is also in a specific format. The response contains information that the computer can use.

RESTful APIs are used to send and receive data from websites, mobile apps, and other computers. They are also used to create new applications and services.

RESTful APIs are easy to use and understand. They are also secure and reliable. They are used by many companies and organizations to make their services more efficient. 

RESTful APIs are like a language that computers use to communicate with each other. They are used to make the internet work better.
