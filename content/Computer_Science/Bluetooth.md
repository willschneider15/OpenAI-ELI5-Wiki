# Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a technology that allows devices, such as phones, computers, and speakers, to connect wirelessly. It works by using radio waves to send and receive data between two devices. The devices need to be within a certain range, usually 10 meters, in order to connect. Once the connection is made, the two devices can share information such as music, photos, and documents. Bluetooth is an easy and convenient way to transfer data between devices without having to use any cables.
