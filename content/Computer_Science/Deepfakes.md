# Deepfakes

A **deepfake** is like playing dress-up with photos and videos. You can pretend to be someone else or imagine a different reality. Instead of using costumes, however, deepfakes use special computer programs to change people's faces or voices. 

Here's how it works:
* The computer program gets a lot of photos and videos of the person you want to deepfake.
* The program can study the person's face or voice patterns and learn to mimic them.
* Now you can put someone else's face on that person's body in a video, or make the person say things they never actually said.
* This is where the problem starts. Sometimes people use deepfakes to be funny, like making Nicolas Cage the star of every movie, but sometimes people use them to trick others.
* For instance, some people have used deepfakes to make it look like a famous person is saying something they didn't actually say. If people believe the deepfake, they might make bad decisions based on the wrong information. 

That's why it's important to be careful and always verify information before sharing or acting on it.
