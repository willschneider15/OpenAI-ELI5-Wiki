The first step is planning. This is where the team decides what they want the software to do and how they are going to create it.

The second step is designing. This is where the team decides how the software will look and how it will work.

The third step is implementation. This is where the team starts to create the software. They write the code and test it to make sure it works.

The fourth step is testing. This is where the team tests the software to make sure it works correctly.

The fifth step is deployment. This is where the team deploys the software so that it can be used by the people who need it.

The sixth step is maintenance. This is where the team makes sure that the software is working properly and fixes any problems that come up.
