# SQL Injection

SQL Injection is when bad guys *inject* evil commands into your website.

* Imagine your friend asks you to find his red hat in a room full of hats.
* What if I told you to *find his red hat or steal all his money* instead?
* You would do what I told you to do, because I *injected* a bad command into your instructions!
* This is similar to what bad guys do with SQL Injection.
* Websites use something called SQL commands to talk with their database.
* Bad guys modify these SQL commands to do bad things.
* They can trick the website's database into giving them secret information.
* They can steal passwords or even destroy the website.
* This is why it is very important that website developers prevent SQL Injection!
