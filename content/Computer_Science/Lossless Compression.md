# Lossless Compression

Lossless Compression is a way to make files smaller without losing any information. It works by taking a file and finding patterns in it. It then replaces the patterns with something smaller, like a code or a symbol. When you want to use the file again, the program can take the code or symbol and turn it back into the original pattern. This way, the file is smaller but still has all the same information as before.
