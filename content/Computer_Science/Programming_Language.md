# Programming Language

Programming languages are like special secret codes that let people talk to computers and tell them what to do. Just like we use different languages to talk to each other, like Spanish or French, programmers use different languages to talk to computers. Here are some things to know about programming languages:

- Each programming language has its own set of rules and grammar that programmers have to follow.
- Different programming languages are used for different things. For example, some languages are better for creating websites, while others are better for making video games.
- Some programming languages are high level, which means they are easier for people to understand but harder for computers to understand. Others are low level, which means they are harder for people to understand but easier for computers to understand.
- Some examples of programming languages include Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.
- Knowing how to use programming languages is an important skill for building all kinds of software, from smartphone apps to computer programs.
