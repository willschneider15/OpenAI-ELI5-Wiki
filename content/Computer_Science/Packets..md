# Packets.

Packets are small chunks of data that are used to transmit information over networks. Packets are divided into two parts: the header and the payload. The header contains information about the packet such as the source and destination address, the packet type, and the packet size. The payload contains the actual data that is being sent, such as text, images, or audio.

Packets are sent over the network using a protocol such as TCP or UDP. When a packet is sent, it is routed through a series of routers until it reaches its destination. Along the way, the packet is inspected by each router to ensure that it is routed correctly.

Packets are an efficient way of transmitting data because they can be sent over long distances without being corrupted. In addition, they are a secure way of transmitting data because they are divided into small pieces and can be reassembled at the destination.
