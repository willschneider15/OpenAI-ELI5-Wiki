# Tree

A tree is like a big family. Just like how you have parents and grandparents, a tree also has a main branch that big branches come out of, which then have smaller branches on them, and those branches can have even smaller branches on them. These branches are called nodes.

Here are some key things to know about trees:

- The main branch is called the root. This is where the tree starts.
- The big branches that come out of the root are called the parent nodes.
- The smaller branches that come out of the parent nodes are called the child nodes.
- A node can have many child nodes, but only one parent node.
- The very end of the branches, where there are no more child nodes, are called the leaf nodes.
- Trees are used a lot in computer science because they are a good way to organize and store information. 

In computer science, trees are used to:

- Organize files and folders on a computer.
- Create search algorithms, like binary search.
- Create data structures that store information in a certain way.
