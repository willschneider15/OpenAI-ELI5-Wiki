# Version Control Systems (Git, SVN, Mercurial)

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools used to track the changes made to a file or set of files over time. They allow you to go back to a previous version of the file if needed. VCSs like Git, SVN, and Mercurial are popular tools used to manage and store versions of files.

When using a VCS, you create a repository which stores all the versions of your files. Every time you make a change to a file, the VCS creates a new version of the file and stores it in the repository. This allows you to go back and view any version of the file, or even restore a previous version if needed.

VCSs also help you to collaborate with others. Multiple people can work on the same file, and the VCS will keep track of all the changes made by each person. This helps to avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same file.

In summary, Version Control Systems are tools used to store and manage versions of files. They help you keep track of changes, and allow you to collaborate with others.
