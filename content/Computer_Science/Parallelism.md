# Parallelism

Parallelism is like doing many things at the same time to get more work done faster. Just like how you can eat cereal and drink juice at the same time, your computer can do multiple tasks simultaneously. 

* Parallelism makes your computer more efficient by using all of its resources at the same time.
* It allows you to run many programs at once without slowing down your computer.
* The tasks may be divided into small parts and run on different cores of a computer processory.
* Parallelism is used in applications like gaming, video rendering, and scientific simulations.
* It can reduce the time it takes to process big data since multiple calculations can be done in parallel.
* Parallelism is also used in distributed computing, where many computers are connected and work together to perform bigger tasks. 

In summary, parallelism is doing multiple things at once to speed up the computer's processing time and get more things done.
