# Parallelism

Parallelism is a way of doing things at the same time. It's like having multiple people working on different tasks at the same time. In computer science, parallelism is the ability of a computer to do multiple tasks at the same time. This is done by splitting the task into smaller pieces and having multiple processors work on each piece. This allows the computer to finish the task faster than if it was done with only one processor. Parallelism is used in many fields, from video games to scientific calculations, to make computers faster and more efficient.
