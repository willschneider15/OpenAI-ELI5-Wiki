# SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with databases. It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve data from a database.

Think of a database like a library. In the library, there are books that contain information. SQL is like the librarian that helps you find the books you need. It helps you search through the database to find the information you need.

SQL uses commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to find and modify data in the database. For example, the SELECT command can be used to search for specific data in the database. The INSERT command can be used to add new data to the database. The UPDATE command can be used to modify existing data in the database. And the DELETE command can be used to remove data from the database.

SQL is a powerful tool that helps users store, manage, and retrieve data from a database. It's like a librarian that helps you find the information you need.
