# SQL

SQL is a language that helps you talk to a database, and it's not too different from talking to a librarian. You give the librarian a list of books you want, and they give you back the books you asked for. SQL does something almost identical. Here are some things you should know about SQL:

* SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language.

* SQL is the language that helps you communicate with databases.

* With SQL, you can create, update, delete, and query information in a database.

* Databases are simply a collection of information that you'd like to be able to access and manipulate easily.

* SQL queries must follow a specific syntax or grammar to work.

* Syntax refers to the fixed set of rules or order in which we write the SQL commands to communicate with the database.

* Once you've written an SQL query, you can send it to a database, and the database will respond with either success or failure, along with any information related to the query that you're asking for.
