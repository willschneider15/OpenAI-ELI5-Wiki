# Scheduling Algorithms

Scheduling algorithms are like rules that tell a computer what tasks it should do and in what order. Suppose you have five tasks to do, but your computer can only do one thing at a time. Scheduling algorithms help the computer decide which task to do first, which task to do next, and so on. Here are some simple scheduling algorithms that computer can use:

- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): The computer does the tasks in the order they were given. It's like standing in a line - whoever comes first gets served first.

- Shortest Job First (SJF): The computer does the tasks that take the shortest amount of time first. It's like doing the easiest or quickest homework first.

- Round Robin (RR): The computer does a little bit of each task in order. It's like doing each homework assignment for 10 minutes before moving on to the next.

Scheduling algorithms are important because they help computers work more efficiently and get more done in less time. Different algorithms work better for different types of tasks, so it's important to choose the right one for the job.
