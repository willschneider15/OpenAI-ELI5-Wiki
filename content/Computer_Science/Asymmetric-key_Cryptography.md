# Asymmetric-key Cryptography

Asymmetric-key Cryptography is a way to keep secrets safe on the internet. It is like having a secret code that only you and your friend can read. Here's how it works:

* There are two keys, one public and one private.
* The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.
* Anything that is encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
* This means that you can send messages to your friend without anyone else being able to read them, because only your friend has the private key to decrypt them.
* Asymmetric-key Cryptography is used to secure online transactions, protect sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers, and to keep emails private.

In summary, Asymmetric-key Cryptography is an important tool for keeping private information safe on the internet. It allows for the secure transfer of information between two parties by using two keys, one public and one private, that are used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
