# Edge Detection

Edge detection is a technique used in computer vision to detect the edges or boundaries between different objects or regions in an image. Imagine looking at a picture of a cat or a dog. You can see the outline of the animal, right? That outline is an edge. In computer science, we need to be able to detect edges so that we can analyze and manipulate images efficiently. Here's how it works:

- The edge detection algorithm looks for differences in color and brightness between adjacent pixels in an image.
- It identifies areas where there are sharp changes in color or brightness.
- These areas are likely to be edges or boundaries between different objects or regions in the image.
- The algorithm then highlights or outlines these areas, making them easier for a computer to process and analyze.

Edge detection is an important tool in computer science, and it is used in a wide range of applications, from medical imaging and facial recognition to robotics and self-driving cars.
