# Character Encoding ASCII

Character Encoding ASCII is a way of representing characters (letters, numbers, symbols) in computers. It assigns a number to each character so that the computer can understand it. For example, the letter "A" is assigned the number 65. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 

ASCII is used to represent text in computers and other devices. It's also used to send information over the internet. When you type something on a computer, the characters are translated into ASCII code which is then sent to the computer or device you're using. The computer or device then translates the code back into characters. 

ASCII is the most common character encoding system and is used by most computers and devices. It is also a standard for encoding text and is used by many programming languages. It is a very important part of computer science and is used to make sure that computers can communicate with each other.
