# SSH

SSH stands for Secure Shell, which is a special way for your computer to talk to another computer.

* It keeps your conversation private (aka encrypted so no one else can hear it)
* Imagine a secret code that only you and your friend know and understand
* With SSH, you can connect to another computer and control it as if you were sitting right in front of it
* This makes it really useful for things like managing servers or just working on a computer that's far away from you
* Without SSH, you might have to do things the old-fashioned way, like sending written messages back and forth (aka snail mail) which takes a lot longer
