# Expression

An expression is like a math equation. It is a combination of numbers, symbols, and words that represent a value. Expressions are used to calculate values, make decisions, and perform operations. For example, the expression 2 + 3 = 5 is used to calculate the value of 5. In programming, expressions are used to assign values to variables, compare values, and perform mathematical operations. Expressions can also be used to make decisions, such as if a number is greater than another number. Expressions are an important part of programming and can be used to create complex programs.
