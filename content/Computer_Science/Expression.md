# Expression

An **expression** is a way to combine values and operators to get a final result. 

* An operator is like a symbol, and it tells the computer what to do with the values.
* Values are the actual pieces of data that the computer uses to calculate the result.

For example, here's an expression: 

```
2 + 3 
```

* The "+" is the operator, and it tells the computer to add the values together.
* The values are 2 and 3.

So the result of this expression is 5. 

Expressions can be more complicated too, like: 

```
5 * (4 - 2) 
```

* This expression has two operators - "*" means "multiply" and "-" means "subtract".
* The values are 5, 4, and 2.

This expression is calculated in two steps: 

1. 4 - 2 = 2 
2. 5 * 2 = 10 

So the result of this expression is 10. 

Expressions are used in programming to make calculations and decisions, so they're an important concept to understand.
