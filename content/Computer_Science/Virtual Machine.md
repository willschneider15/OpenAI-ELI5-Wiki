# Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a computer program that acts like a real computer. It runs on top of an existing computer and provides a virtual environment for running programs and applications. It is like having two computers in one, since the VM acts like a separate computer from the actual computer it is running on.

The VM can be used to run different operating systems and applications, allowing users to switch between them quickly and easily. It also allows users to test new software and applications without having to install them on the actual computer.

The VM also provides a layer of security, since it can be used to isolate certain applications and programs from the actual computer. This way, if something goes wrong with the application or program, it won't affect the actual computer.

Overall, the Virtual Machine is a great tool for running multiple operating systems, testing new software, and providing an extra layer of security.
