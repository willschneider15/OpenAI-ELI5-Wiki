# JSON

JSON is an acronym which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. 

- JSON is a file format that is often used to transfer data between computers or applications.
- It is simple and easy to read by both computers and humans.
- JSON files contain data that is structured in a key-value format, similar to a dictionary or a phonebook.
- In a JSON file, data is stored in pairs, where one value corresponds to one key.
- For example, a key "name" can have a value "John Smith", or a key "age" can have a value "25".
- JSON can be used with many programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.
- It is commonly used with REST APIs to transfer data between servers and clients.
- Its lightweight nature makes it a popular choice for web development, specifically for handling data transfer and storage. 

Overall, JSON is a simple, flexible and efficient means for exchanging data between different applications that need to be connected.
