# JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a way of representing data in a format that is easy for computers to understand and work with. In JSON, data is stored in key-value pairs. Keys are strings that tell the computer what kind of data is being stored, and values are the actual pieces of data. For example, a key might be "name" and the value might be "John Doe". JSON is popular because it is a simple, efficient way of organizing data, and can be used to send data between computers. It is also very easy to read and understand, making it a great choice for web applications.
