# Data Types

Data types are the different kinds of data that a computer can store and process. They are used to tell the computer what type of information is being stored and how it should be handled.

For example, a string data type stores text, such as a name or address. An integer data type stores numbers without a decimal point, such as the age of a person. A floating point data type stores numbers with a decimal point, such as the price of an item.

Data types are important because they allow the computer to understand how to process the data. Without data types, the computer wouldnâ€™t know how to interpret the data it is receiving. All data types have their own rules and limitations, so it is important to understand the different types and how they work.
