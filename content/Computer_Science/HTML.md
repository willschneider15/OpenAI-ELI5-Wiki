# HTML

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." It is a language that is used to create web pages. With HTML, you can create text, images, links, and other types of content that can be displayed on a website. 

Here are some things you should know about HTML:

* HTML uses special codes called "tags" to identify different kinds of content
* Tags are used to define the structure of a webpage, such as headlines, paragraphs, and links
* A basic HTML document will usually contain an opening tag, a closing tag, and content in between
* HTML can be used to create simple, static web pages or more complex, dynamic websites with interactive features
* HTML is the foundation of the web and is used in conjunction with other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to create beautiful and functional websites. 

In summary, HTML is the language that is used to create the structure and content of web pages. Without HTML, there would be no web!
