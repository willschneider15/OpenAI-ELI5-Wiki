# HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to create webpages. HTML is made up of tags that are used to structure a webpage. These tags tell the browser which parts of the page are headings, paragraphs, images, and more. When you open a webpage, the browser reads the HTML code and displays it as a webpage. HTML also allows you to add links that let you jump to a different page when clicked. HTML is the foundation of the web, and it is used to create amazing things!
