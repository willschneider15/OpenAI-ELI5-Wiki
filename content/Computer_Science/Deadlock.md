# Deadlock

Deadlock is a problem that can happen when two people need something from each other to finish their own task. In the computer world, this happens when two programs or processes are waiting for each other to finish and neither can move forward.

Think of playing catch with a friend. You throw the ball to your friend and they have to throw it back to you so you can catch it again. If your friend doesn't throw the ball back, you can't catch it and the game can't continue. This is like a deadlock - two things need each other to continue, but neither can move forward.

In computers, deadlock can cause programs to freeze or crash. It happens when:
* Two or more processes are waiting for something the other has (like a locked resource)
* Neither process can move forward until it gets what it's waiting for
* And neither process will give up what it has (relinquish the locked resource)

Deadlock is an important concept to understand in computer science because it can cause big problems in software systems. Programmers use strategies like avoiding circular wait, using timeouts, and releasing resources in a specific order to prevent deadlocks from happening.
