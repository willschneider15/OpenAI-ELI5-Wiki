# Deadlock

Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are stuck in a loop, waiting for each other to finish. It usually occurs when two processes try to access the same resource at the same time. Each process holds a resource that the other process needs, so they are both stuck waiting for the other one to finish. Deadlock can cause a computer to stop working, because the processes can't move forward. It's important to design systems that avoid deadlock, because it can be difficult to recover from it.
