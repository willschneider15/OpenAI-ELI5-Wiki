# NoSQL

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and is a type of database that doesn't use the traditional tabular relational database structure. Instead, it uses documents, graphs, and key-value pairs to store and manage data. NoSQL databases are often used when scalability and flexibility are important, since they don't have the same constraints as relational databases. They are also often used when data needs to be stored in a distributed or cloud environment since they can easily handle large amounts of data. In short, NoSQL is a type of database that is designed to store and manage data in a more flexible and scalable way than a traditional relational database.
