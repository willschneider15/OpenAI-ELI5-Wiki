# CPU

A CPU or Central Processing Unit is the brain of a computer. It helps the computer to think, make decisions and do tasks. It sits on the motherboard of a computer and is made up of small switches called transistors. These switches do things like turn on and off, or allow for calculations to be made. 

The CPU has three main jobs: 

* Fetching instructions - the CPU gets all the commands from the computer's memory. 
* Decoding instructions - the CPU figures out what those instructions mean. 
* Executing instructions - the CPU carries out the instructions in the right order, like opening a program or showing a video. 

The faster the CPU can do these three things, the faster the computer can work. A faster CPU means a faster and more efficient computer. 

There are different types of CPUs that have different numbers of cores, speed and cache size. It's important to choose the right CPU for the work you want to do. Sometimes you need a powerful CPU for gaming or video editing, and sometimes you just need a basic one for browsing the web or creating documents.
