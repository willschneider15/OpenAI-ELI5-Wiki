# IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is like an online store that sells everything you need to build a house. 

* Instead of items like wood and bricks, in IaaS, you buy things like servers, storage, and networking.
* These are the basic building blocks of a technology infrastructure.
* Like building a house, you can pick and choose exactly what you need for your project.
* Once youâ€™ve bought everything you need, you can set everything up in your house.
* In the same way, you can use the services you bought from the IaaS provider to build the infrastructure and environment for your technology project.
* Instead of building servers and infrastructure yourself, you can use services from cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
* This saves time, money, and resources because you do not have to manage and maintain hardware and data centers yourself.
