# IaaS

IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It is a type of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

IaaS is like having a virtual machine in the cloud. It is a way to rent computing resources, like servers, storage and networking, from a cloud provider. With IaaS, you don't need to buy and manage your own physical hardware.

Instead, you can access and use the resources from the cloud provider. You can use these resources to build and run applications and services. You can also scale up or down your resources as needed.

IaaS is a convenient way to access computing resources on demand. It is also cost-effective, since you only pay for what you use.

IaaS is a great way to get started with cloud computing and can help you focus on developing your applications and services instead of managing hardware.
