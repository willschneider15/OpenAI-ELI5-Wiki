# Smart Grid

Smart Grid is like a really smart way to use electricity. 

* Just like a smart phone is smarter than a regular phone, a smart grid is smarter than a regular electricity grid.
* It uses computers and sensors to monitor and control electricity use.
* This helps make the electricity grid more efficient and reliable.
* It can also help reduce costs and decrease the need to build new power plants.
* For example, if there are a lot of people using electricity in one area, the smart grid can send more electricity to that area to make sure everyone has enough.
* If there are only a few people using electricity in another area, the smart grid can send less electricity to save energy.
* Smart grids can also use renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, to help reduce pollution and protect the environment.
* Overall, a smart grid helps make sure we have the electricity we need, when we need it, and in a way that's good for the environment.
