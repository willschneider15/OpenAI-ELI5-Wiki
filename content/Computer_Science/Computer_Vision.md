# Computer Vision

Computer Vision is like giving eyes to a computer so it can see, just like we do! It involves programming computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world around us. 

* Cameras and sensors are used by computers to collect visual data, just like our eyes and brain collect information 
* This collected data is then analyzed, processed and transformed by the computer 
* From this information, the computer can identify and classify objects it sees, detect motion or changes in the environment, and even estimate depth and distance perception 
* Computer vision is used in many real-world applications like face recognition, self-driving cars, medical imaging, and security systems 
* Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the way we live in the future 

By using computer vision, we can make computers smart enough to see and understand the world around us, just like we do.
