# Bare Metal

Bare Metal is a term used to describe a computer system that runs directly on hardware without any software or operating system. It is often used to refer to a single computer that has been stripped down to its bare essentials, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. This type of system is usually used for specialized applications, such as embedded systems or high-performance computing.

Bare Metal systems work by directly controlling the hardware components, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. This allows the system to have direct access to the hardware and run more efficiently than if it were running on an operating system. It also allows the system to be more flexible, as it can be tailored to specific needs.

Bare Metal systems are often used in embedded systems, where the system needs to be very small and efficient. They are also used in high-performance computing, where the system needs to be able to handle large amounts of data quickly. In addition, Bare Metal systems can be used for other specialized applications, such as running virtual machines or providing remote access.
