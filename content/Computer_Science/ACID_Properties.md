# ACID Properties

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are a set of principles that ensure data transactions are accurate and reliable. Letâ€™s explore each of these principles and what they mean.

- Atomicity means that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible operation. In other words, if a transaction involves multiple steps, either all of them are executed or none of them are executed. This ensures that data is never left in a partially updated state, which could lead to errors or inconsistencies.

- Consistency means that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. The data must meet all constraints and specifications set forth by the database schema. This ensures that any changes made to the database are valid and in compliance with defined rules.

- Isolation means that each transaction must be executed independently of any other transactions. This is important when multiple users are trying to access the same data simultaneously. Isolation ensures that transactions do not interfere with one another, and data remains accurate.

- Durability means that once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the database permanently. In the event of a power outage, system crash, or other failure, the database will recover the completed transactions from its log file to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted.

Taken together, ACID principles ensure that database transactions are reliable, accurate, and safe from data loss or corruption.
