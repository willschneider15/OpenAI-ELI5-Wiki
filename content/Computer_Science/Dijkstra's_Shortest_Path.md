# Dijkstra's Shortest Path

Dijkstra's shortest path is a method used to find the quickest way to get from one place to another. Think of it this way: 

- imagine you have a town with lots of different roads, each with different lengths.
- You want to find the shortest route to get from your house to the grocery store. 
- Dijkstra's algorithm helps you figure out which roads to take in order to get there the quickest.

So how does it work?

- First, you identify all the roads that you can take from your starting point (your house). 
- You then calculate the distance from your starting point to each of these roads. 
- You choose the road that takes you the shortest distance from your starting point, and mark it as "visited." This means you won't consider it again. 
- You repeat this process for each of the unvisited roads you identified in the first step. 
- Eventually, you will have found the shortest path to your destination!

Overall, Dijkstra's algorithm helps you find the quickest and most efficient route between two points, using a graph to identify paths and distances.
