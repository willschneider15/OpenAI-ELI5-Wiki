# Data Warehousing

Data Warehousing is like having a big toy box.

* Imagine your toy box is your computer, and it's full of toys (information).
* You may have some toys that you play with all the time and others that you play with less frequently.
* Just like you might organize your toys into different boxes for easy access, data warehousing organizes information in a specific way.
* By organizing information into sections or categories, you can easily find and access the information you need whenever. 
* This helps people who want to use the information in different ways have an easier time finding what they need, much like how you may need a certain toy to play a particular game.
* This toy box is also able to clean up and throw away any toys that you don't use anymore, similar to how a data warehouse expunges outdated or useless information.
* A data warehouse is just a more efficient way to organize information.
