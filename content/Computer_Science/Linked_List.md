# Linked List

A linked list is like a train 

* Imagine you have a train with lots of cars joined together by hooks
* Each car is carrying a number or a piece of information
* The first car is called the head and it tells you where the train starts
* The last car is called the tail and it tells you where the train ends
* You can add more cars to the train or remove cars if you need to
* Each car only knows about the car in front of it and the car behind it
* You can't skip cars, you have to go one by one
* You can search for a specific car by starting at the head and looking through each car until you find it
* If you want to add a new car, you can join it to the train by hooking it between two existing cars
* If you want to remove a car, you just unhook it from the train and reconnect the remaining cars
