# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool used to detect malicious activity on a computer network. It monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the user when something is detected. The IDS can be used to identify unauthorized access to a system, detect malicious software, and block malicious traffic. It can also be used to detect data breaches, detect malicious activities such as Denial of Service attacks, and provide information on suspicious activities. The IDS can be configured to alert the user when an attack is detected, or it can be used to log the activity for further investigation. The IDS can be used to detect threats before they become a problem, allowing the user to take proactive steps to protect the system.
