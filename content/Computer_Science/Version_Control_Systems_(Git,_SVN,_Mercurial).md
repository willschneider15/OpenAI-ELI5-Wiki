# Version Control Systems (Git, SVN, Mercurial)

Version Control Systems (VCS) are like superheroes for programmers. They help you keep track of all the changes (additions, deletions, modifications) that you make to your program's code using different tools such as Git, SVN, and Mercurial. 

They work like your own personal time machine! 
* They allow you to go back in time and undo changes that you don't want anymore, or access an older version of your code if things go wrong. 
* VCS allow you to collaborate with others, for example, by allowing multiple people to work on the same program at the same time without interfering with each other's work.
* It allows you to make a copy of the program before you make any major change, this helps you compare the old and new versions, and see how your new additions compare to the old version.  

VCS can also serve as a backup system, which means if your computer crashes, all of your files will still be secure and easily accessible. 

Overall, with these VCS tools, programming is made easy peasy lemon squeezy!
