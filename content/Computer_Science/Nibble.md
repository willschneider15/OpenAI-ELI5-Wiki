# Nibble

A **nibble** is like a small piece of candy, but for computers! Instead of being sweet and tasty, a nibble is made up of bits, which are tiny pieces of information that computers use to store and process data. 

Here are some key things to know about nibbles:
- A nibble is made up of 4 bits, which can be either 0's or 1's.
- Nibbles are used to represent numerical values in binary form. For example, the nibble "1001" represents the number 9.
- Two nibbles combined form a byte, which is an even smaller unit of computer memory.
- Nibbles are not used as frequently today, as modern computers generally work with bytes or even larger units of information.
- However, nibbles were commonly used in older computers or in certain specialized applications (such as graphic design or cryptography) that require finer control over information.

So, in summary: a nibble is a small and simple way for computers to represent numerical values in binary form. Yum!
