# Nibble

A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or a half-byte. It is represented by a single hexadecimal digit and can store up to 16 different values (0-15). A nibble can be used to represent a single hexadecimal digit, a single character of text, or a small piece of data.

In computer science, a nibble is often used to store small pieces of data. For example, a nibble can be used to store a single letter of the alphabet, a single digit, or a single hexadecimal digit. A nibble can also be used to store a single bit of information, such as a boolean value (true/false).

Nibbles are also used to store larger pieces of data, such as a byte or a word. A byte is made up of two nibbles, and a word is made up of four nibbles. By combining nibbles, larger pieces of data can be stored in a more efficient way.

Nibbles are also used in computer memory and storage. A nibble is the smallest unit of data that can be stored in a computer memory. By storing data in nibbles, more data can
