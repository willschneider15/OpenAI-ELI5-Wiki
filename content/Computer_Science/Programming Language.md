# Programming Language

Programming language is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. It is like a language that humans use, but computers understand it better. It is like a code that a computer can understand and follow. 

Programming languages are used to create software, websites, and apps. They are used to give instructions to the computer so that it can perform certain tasks. People who write programs are called programmers. They use programming languages to create instructions that the computer can understand. 

Programming languages are like words and sentences in a language. They are made up of words, numbers, and symbols that tell the computer what to do. For example, if you want the computer to add two numbers together, you would use a programming language to tell it to do that.

Programming languages are used to create all sorts of things, from video games to robots. They are used to make computers do things that humans can't do on their own. By using programming languages, people can create amazing things with computers.
