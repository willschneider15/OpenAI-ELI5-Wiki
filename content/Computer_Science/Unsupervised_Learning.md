# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is like playing with Legos without instructions. You have a box of different types of Legos and you try to build something without knowing what it is. You start sorting out the pieces and see that there are similar pieces that you can group together. By doing that, you can start seeing patterns and come up with your own idea of what you want to build!

Similarly, unsupervised learning involves sorting data into clusters based on common/distinguishable characteristics or patterns. 

- This type of machine learning does not involve a supervisor or labeled data, which means the software must find relationships and groupings on its own. 
- The algorithm groups similar data points together and can either determine the number of clusters or assume the number beforehand.
- The goal is to find structure and meaning in the data without any prior knowledge of what patterns may emerge. 
- It is used to identify anomalies, patterns or trends in data, without the need for manual annotation or labeling. 

Unsupervised learning can be used in various domains like- 
- Recommender systems
- Clustering documents in topic Modeling
- Social Networking Analysis 
- Image segmentation 
- Pattern recognition
- etc. 

Unsupervised Learning algorithms include K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Principal component analysis, etc.
