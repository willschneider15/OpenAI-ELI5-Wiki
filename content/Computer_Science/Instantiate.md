# Instantiate

Instantiating is just like building a LEGO set:

* When you get a LEGO box, you have to build it to create the model in the picture.
* Similarly, when we instantiate an object in Computer Science, we create a copy of a model or class that has already been defined.
* The model or class contains the blueprint for how the object should look and behave.
* The instantiated object is a specific instance of the model or class with its own unique data (or instance variables) and behaviors (or methods) that can be used or manipulated by the program.
* Think of a class as the blueprint for a house, and each instance of the class is a specific house built from that blueprint. Just like each house might have different furniture or belongings inside of it, each instance of the class can have unique values for its instance variables. 

In summary, instantiating is the process of creating an object from a class, much like building a LEGO set to create a specific model.
