# Instantiate

Instantiate is a concept used in computer programming. It is the process of taking an object or class and creating an instance of it. This means that you are creating a specific version of the object or class that can be used in your program. 

To instantiate something, you need to provide the necessary information that the object or class requires. This information can include variables, functions, and other data. Once the object or class is instantiated, you can use it in your program. 

For example, if you are building a game, you may have a class called "Player". When you instantiate this class, you could provide the player's name, health, and other attributes. These attributes would then be used in the game. 

In summary, instantiating is the process of taking an object or class and creating a version of it that can be used in a computer program. It requires providing the necessary information that the object or class requires in order to be used.
