# Unit Testing

Unit testing is a way of testing individual parts of a program to make sure they work properly. It is like a doctor checking to make sure all of your body parts are healthy and working correctly. 

Unit testing involves breaking down the program into small pieces and testing each piece separately. For example, if you have a program that adds two numbers together, you would test each part of the program separately to make sure it works correctly. You would test the part that adds the numbers, the part that stores the numbers, and the part that displays the result. 

Unit testing helps find bugs and errors in the code quickly so they can be fixed before the program is released. It also helps make sure that the program works correctly when new features are added or existing features are changed. 

Overall, unit testing is an important part of making sure that a program works correctly and efficiently.
