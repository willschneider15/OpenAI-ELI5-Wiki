# FPGA

FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array. It is an integrated circuit that can be programmed after it has been manufactured. FPGAs are used to create custom logic circuits and can be used to replace many components, such as memory and processors. FPGAs are made up of many small logic blocks called cells, which can be configured to create custom logic functions. These cells can be connected together in various ways to create the desired logic circuit. FPGAs are very fast and can be used to create complex logic functions, making them very useful for a variety of applications. FPGAs are also very versatile, as they can be reprogrammed to create different logic functions. This makes them ideal for applications that require frequent changes or upgrades.
