# FPGA

**FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array**, but what does it actually mean? Let me explain it simply:
 
* Have you ever played with LEGO blocks? FPGA is like that but instead of building a spaceship or a castle, we build electrical circuits.
* These circuits are used in electronic devices to make them work. For example, a computer has a circuit to add numbers together.
* With an FPGA we can build circuits that do anything we want. It's like creating our own electronic device.
* The special thing about FPGA is that we can change these circuits after we have built them. It's like melting our LEGO spaceship and building a new one. We can do this as many times as we want.
* This is useful because if we make a mistake or if we want to add more things to it, we can easily change it instead of building the circuits from scratch. **FPGA is used a lot in research** because we can make changes quickly without having to build everything again.
 
That's all there is to it!
