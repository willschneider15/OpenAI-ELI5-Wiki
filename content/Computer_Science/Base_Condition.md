# Base Condition

Base Condition is a condition that a program needs to meet before it can move on to the next step. It's like getting permission to do something else. 

Think of it like this: You want to play a board game, but you can only start playing if you have all the necessary pieces. You check the pieces and find that you have them all. This is the base condition for you to start playing the game. Now, you can play the game and move on to the next step. 

In programming, Base Condition is used to make sure that everything needed for a program to work is present. It acts as a gatekeeper, allowing the program to move forward only when certain conditions are met. 

For example, imagine a program that calculates the sum of a series of numbers. The base condition for this program would be the presence of the input numbers. If there are no numbers, the program cannot perform the calculation. 

Base Condition is also used in recursion, which is a programming technique that calls a function within itself. In this case, the base condition is what helps the function stop calling itself and exit the recursion.
