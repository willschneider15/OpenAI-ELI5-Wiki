# File Systems

A **file system** is like a big cabinet where we put all our things such as clothes, books, and toys to keep them organized. 

In the computer, the file system does something similar. It's like the computer's closet, where we save and organize all our computer files. 

It helps store and organize all the files on a computer in a way that makes them easily accessible to the user whenever they need them. 

A file system is like a map, it helps you find where a file is located. 

Some common file systems are NTFS (Windows), EXT4 (Linux), and HFS+ (Mac). 

Without a file system, computers would take a lot more time searching for files and wouldn't be able to keep track of them as well. 

Overall, a file system is a crucial part of the computer which allows us to keep track of our files and minimize clutter.
