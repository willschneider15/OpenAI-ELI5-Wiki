# Declarative

Declarative programming is a way of telling a computer what to do, without telling it how to do it. It is a type of programming language that focuses on what needs to be done, rather than how to do it. 

Essentially, declarative programming allows programmers to focus on the desired outcome and the computer is responsible for figuring out the best way to achieve it. For example, if a programmer wants to add two numbers, they would simply write a statement that says “add two numbers” and the computer would handle the rest.

Declarative programming is often used to create user interfaces, where the programmer can create a set of instructions that will be used to create a user interface. The programmer can also use declarative programming to create databases, where they can define the structure of the data and the computer will be responsible for managing it.

Declarative programming is a great way to make programming easier and more efficient. It allows programmers to focus on the desired outcome and the computer is responsible for figuring out the best way to achieve it.
