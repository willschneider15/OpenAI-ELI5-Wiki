# Declarative

Declarative programming is like giving a recipe to a friend. Instead of telling them how to do each step, you just tell them what the end result should be. 

* It is a programming paradigm.
* It is a way to design the structure and elements of computer programs.
* It emphasizes on describing what the program should accomplish, rather than how it should be done.
* It focuses on creating a set of instructions that define the outcome and allows the system to interpret them.
* It is like giving instructions for a cake recipe, where you focus on the ingredients and their quantity rather than the detailed steps.
* Declarative programming languages include SQL, HTML, CSS, and Prolog.
* Declarative programming is less concerned with how the program carries out a function, so it is simpler to write and easier to understand.
* It is useful in applications like artificial intelligence, natural language programming, and web development.
