# Computer Security

Computer security is the practice of protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access or damage. It is important to protect computers from hackers, viruses, and other malicious activities.

Computer security includes measures like firewalls, encryption, and antivirus software. Firewalls can block unwanted access to a computer or network. Encryption scrambles data so it can't be read if it is intercepted. Antivirus software scans for and removes malicious software.

Other methods of computer security include keeping software and operating systems up to date and using strong passwords. It's also important to back up important data in case of a system failure or attack.

Computer security is important for businesses and individuals alike. Without it, valuable data can be stolen or destroyed, and networks can be compromised.
