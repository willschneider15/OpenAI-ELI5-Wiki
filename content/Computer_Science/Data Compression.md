# Data Compression

Data Compression is a way of making data smaller. It works by taking a large file and making it smaller so it takes up less space. When the file is compressed, it is still the same file, but it takes up less space. To compress a file, a computer looks for patterns in the data and then replaces those patterns with shorter codes. This way, the same data takes up less space. For example, if you have a large file with the same word repeated many times, the computer can replace the word with a shorter code. This makes the file smaller and easier to store.
