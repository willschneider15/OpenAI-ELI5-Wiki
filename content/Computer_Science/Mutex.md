# Mutex

A Mutex is a way for computer programs to share resources without conflicting with each other. It is like a lock that prevents two programs from using the same resource at the same time. When one program has the lock, the other programs have to wait until the lock is released before they can use the resource. This ensures that each program can use the resource without any interference from other programs. Mutex is a great way to make sure that programs don't conflict with each other and can share resources without any problems.
