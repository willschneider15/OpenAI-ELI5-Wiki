# Load Balancing

Load balancing is like sharing candy.

#### Imagine a class that has 20 students and a bag of 100 candies.

* Without load balancing, one student might end up eating all the candy, while the other students get sad and have no candy.
* With load balancing, the candies would be evenly split among all 20 students. Each student gets 5 candies and everyone is happy.

#### In computer science, load balancing works similarly.

* In this case, instead of candies, we are dealing with requests that come to a website or application.
* If all the requests go to just one server, it may get overwhelmed and crash, just like the one student who eats all the candies.
* Load balancing helps distribute the requests among multiple servers, so that no single server gets too much traffic and everything runs smoothly.
* This is important for websites and apps that have lots of traffic and need to handle hundreds or thousands of requests at the same time.
