# DevOps

DevOps is a combination of two words, Development and Operations. It means that Developers and IT Operations work together to improve software delivery and maintenance. Just imagine that you're building a sandcastle. 

* Developers are the ones who design the sandcastle and make sure it's the best sandcastle possible. 
* IT Operations people are the ones who help them build it by giving them the tools they need like a bucket or shovel. 
* Once the sandcastle is built, IT Operations people help make sure it stays standing and maintains it to keep it looking beautiful. 

Similarly, in the software world: 

* Developers are responsible for creating new software features and updating them. 
* IT Operations team is responsible for making sure the software works properly on the hardware and maintaining it after it goes live. 

DevOps is a process or philosophy in which Developers and IT Operations team work together, communicate and collaborate to streamline and optimize the software delivery process for a company. It enables faster delivery, better quality, and more reliable software releases. In summary, DevOps is a collaborative, continuous improvement process of software delivery and maintenance.
