# DevOps

DevOps is a way of working that combines the roles of development (coding) and operations (managing the system). It encourages collaboration between the two teams and helps to automate processes and make them more efficient. 

In DevOps, developers and operations teams work together to create a product or service. They use tools to automate tasks, such as code testing and deployment. This helps to speed up the process and make it more reliable. 

The goal of DevOps is to make sure that the product or service is always running smoothly and efficiently. This means that when changes are made, they are quickly tested and deployed. This helps to reduce the amount of time it takes to launch a product or service. 

DevOps also helps to reduce the amount of time it takes to troubleshoot problems. By having a close collaboration between the development and operations teams, they can quickly identify and fix any issues. 

Overall, DevOps is a way of working that helps teams to work together more efficiently and quickly launch products or services. It also helps to reduce the amount of time it takes to troubleshoot issues.
