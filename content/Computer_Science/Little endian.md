# Little endian

Little endian is a way of organizing data in memory. It is the opposite of big endian, which stores the most significant byte (the "big end") of a data item first. In little endian, the least significant byte (the "little end") of the data item is stored first.

For example, if you had a four-byte data item such as a 32-bit integer, the big endian way of storing it would be to store the most significant byte first, followed by the second most significant byte, followed by the third most significant byte, and finally the least significant byte.

In contrast, the little endian way of storing the same four-byte data item would be to store the least significant byte first, followed by the third most significant byte, followed by the second most significant byte, and finally the most significant byte.

Little endian is used in many computer systems, including PCs, laptops, and mobile devices. It is also used in networking protocols such as TCP/IP. Little endian is often preferred because it can be more efficient when it comes to accessing data in memory.
