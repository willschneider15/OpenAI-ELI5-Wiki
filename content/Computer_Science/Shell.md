# Shell

A **shell** is a special program that we use to communicate or talk to a computer. Imagine you have a friend who only speaks a different language, who doesn't understand you when you talk. A shell, then, is like having a translator between you and the computer. You tell the shell what you want to do or where you want to go, and then it translates that into a language the computer can understand.

* The shell is a program that manages the operating system of a computer.
* It allows us to give instructions to the computer through a command-line interface.
* The shell can read and interpret our commands, and then communicate with the computer to execute those commands.
* The most commonly used shell in Linux and Unix systems is called the Bash shell.
* By using the shell, we can interact with the computer in a more flexible and powerful way than we can through graphical interfaces.
