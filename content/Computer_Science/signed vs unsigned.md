# signed vs unsigned

Signed and unsigned numbers are used to represent values in computer programming. Signed numbers are those that can represent both positive and negative values, while unsigned numbers represent only positive values. 

For example, a signed 8-bit number can represent values from -128 to +127, while an unsigned 8-bit number can represent values from 0 to 255.

Signed numbers are usually represented using two's complement notation, which is a way of representing negative numbers as the complement of their positive counterparts. For example, the number -3 is represented as 11111101.

Unsigned numbers are usually represented in binary form, which is a way of representing numbers in base-2. For example, the number 7 is represented as 00000111.

In general, signed numbers are used when representing negative values, while unsigned numbers are used when representing positive values.
