# Interpreted

Interpreted programming languages are like a chef who cooks the food as soon as the customer places the order. Here are some points that might help you understand:

- When we write our program in an interpreted language, it gets translated into machine code (the code that a computer understands) line by line, while it's being executed.
- This means that we don't need to compile (or convert) the entire program beforehand like we do with compiled languages. 
- Interpreted languages are usually slower than compiled languages because the translation happens at runtime, but they are more flexible because we can make changes to the code and see the results immediately. 
- Popular interpreted programming languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. 

In short, interpreted languages are like cooking on-demand - we don't need to prepare the whole meal in advance, but it might take a bit longer to get the food ready.
