# Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing information in databases so that it is efficient, easy to understand, and easy to use. It is like cleaning and organizing a messy room.

Here are the key points about normalization:

- A database is like a collection of lots of different pieces of information, like a big box of Legos. Normalization helps us put those pieces of information together in a logical way, like building a Lego tower.
- Imagine that you have a list of customers and each customer has a lot of information associated with them, like name, address, phone number, email, and order history. If we put all of that information in one big table, it would be confusing and inefficient to work with. Normalization helps us break that information up into smaller, organized tables.
- There are several levels of normalization, called normal forms. Each normal form has a set of rules that the data must adhere to in order to be considered normalized. The higher the normal form, the more organized and efficient the data is.
- Normalization helps us avoid data redundancy, which is when the same information is stored in multiple places. This can lead to inconsistencies and errors in the data.
- Normalization may involve creating relationships between different tables in a database, which allows us to easily query and analyze the data in useful ways.
