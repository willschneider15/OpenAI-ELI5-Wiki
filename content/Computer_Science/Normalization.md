# Normalization

Normalization is a way of organizing data in a database. It helps to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It is based on the idea of breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable ones.

Normalization involves dividing data into smaller tables and linking them together with keys. This helps to reduce data duplication and makes it easier to find and update data. It also helps to ensure that data is stored in a consistent format.

Normalization is a process that is done in multiple steps. Each step is called a "normal form" and it helps to make sure that data is organized in the best way possible. Each normal form has a set of rules that must be followed in order to ensure that the data is stored correctly and efficiently.
