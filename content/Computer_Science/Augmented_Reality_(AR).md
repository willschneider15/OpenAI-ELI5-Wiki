# Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented Reality (AR) is like bringing a special magic lens with you wherever you go. 

* This magic lens overlays digital information onto the real world around you. 
* It's like seeing a virtual layer on top of the real world.
* Imagine holding up your phone to point at a street and seeing information about the buildings around you. 
* Or pointing your phone at a plant and seeing what it is, how to take care of it, and how it will look when it's grown.
* AR can be used on phones, tablets, headsets, and glasses. 
* It can make learning, gaming, and exploring more immersive and interactive.
* AR can also be used in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and retail.
* The possibilities for AR are endless and it's an exciting technology to keep an eye on.
