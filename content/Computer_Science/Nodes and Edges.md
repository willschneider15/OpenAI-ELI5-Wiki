# Nodes and Edges

Nodes and edges are basic concepts in computer science. Nodes are points or locations on a network or graph. They can represent anything from people, to places, to objects. Edges are the lines that connect the nodes together. They represent the relationships between the nodes, or the paths that you can take to get from one node to another.

For example, if you were to draw a graph of your family tree, each person in your family would be a node, and the lines that connect them would be edges. The edges represent the relationships between people, such as parents and children, siblings, or cousins.

Nodes and edges are used in many different areas of computer science, from social networks to databases. They are also used to represent data, such as in graphs. Understanding nodes and edges is an important part of computer science and can help you understand how data is connected and organized.
