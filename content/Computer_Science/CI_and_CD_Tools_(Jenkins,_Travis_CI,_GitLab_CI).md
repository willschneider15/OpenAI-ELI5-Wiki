# CI and CD Tools (Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are tools that help software development teams publish updates frequently, automatically and in a controlled manner. 

These tools are used to build, test, and deploy software applications in a repeatable and reliable way. They enable software teams to detect and fix software errors early in the development process, allowing for faster delivery of higher quality software.

Here are some things to know about CI/CD tools:

* Jenkins, Travis CI and GitLab CI are three popular CI/CD tools.
* They automatically detect when new code is added to a repository.
* They build and test the code automatically.
* If the code passes the tests, they deploy the new application code to staging server or production server.
* This reduces the likelihood of human error when deploying new code, making the process more consistent and efficient.
* They help catch mistakes early in the development process, saving time and money.

CI and CD tools are powerful allies in delivering high-quality software quickly and efficiently.
