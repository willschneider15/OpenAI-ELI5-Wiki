# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is like teaching a dog new tricks but instead, computers learn how to perform tasks by themselves. 

- Think of RL as a computer playing a game like chess, but it doesnâ€™t know how to play it.
- The computer starts by making random moves, and if it wins or makes a good move, it gets a reward. If it loses or makes a bad move, it gets a punishment.
- The computer learns from the rewards and punishments and adjusts its gameplay accordingly.
- This process is repeated through many rounds of the game until the computer becomes an expert player.
- Similar to training a dog, the computer is continuously learning from the feedback it receives and becoming better at the task with each attempt.
- In conclusion, RL is a technique that allows computers to learn by themselves through trial and error by receiving feedback in the form of rewards and punishments.
