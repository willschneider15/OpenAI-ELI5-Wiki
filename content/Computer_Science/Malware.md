# Malware

Malware is a type of software that is designed to harm your computer, or the information on it. It can be spread via email or websites, and can be used to gather information, disrupt computer systems, or take control of your computer. Malware can be hidden in files and programs, or can be disguised as a legitimate program. It can be difficult to detect, as it often does not show any obvious signs. If malware is installed on your computer, it can damage your data, slow down your computer, or even allow someone else to gain access to your information. The best way to protect yourself from malware is to be careful when downloading files or programs, and to have a good antivirus program installed.
