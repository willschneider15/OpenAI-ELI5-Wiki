# Properties

Imagine you have a toy car. The car has a color, make, and a model. These are called its properties. Properties are the features that define an object. In programming, properties work in a similar way.

Here are some things to know about properties in programming:

* Properties are attributes of an object.
* An object can have one or more properties.
* Properties can be accessed, modified, or deleted dynamically during the execution of a program.
* The properties of an object can be used to change its behavior or appearance.

Properties, therefore, are a way of organizing and managing data within a program. They allow you to create objects that have specific attributes, which you can then manipulate as needed. In other words, properties help you create more flexible and dynamic programs.
