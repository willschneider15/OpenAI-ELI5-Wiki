# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a programming language that is used to create cool things on the Internet. It helps make websites more interactive and fun to use!

Here are some things to understand about JavaScript:

- It's a language that computers understand
- We use it to tell the computer how to do things on a website
- It can use information that we provide or that the computer already has (like the size of the screen or what button was clicked)
- We can use it to make things happen on the website without needing to go to another page or reload the page (like showing a new picture or confirming that you really meant to leave a page)
- You can try it yourself on many websites by playing around with the menus and options or by typing code into the browser's console

JavaScript is a big part of what makes the Internet such an interesting and useful place, and by learning it you are taking the first steps towards becoming a creator of that world!
