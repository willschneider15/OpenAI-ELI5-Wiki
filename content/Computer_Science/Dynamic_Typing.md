# Dynamic Typing

Dynamic Typing is a concept in Computer Science where the type, or kind, of data stored in a variable can change during runtime. This means that a variable can hold different types of data at different points in time, without us, the programmers, having to declare its type ahead of time.

To help make this idea easier to understand, here is an example:

Think of a toy box that can hold different types of toys. You can put a car inside, then take it out and replace it with a doll. The toy box doesn't care what type of toy it holds, it just holds whatever toy you put inside. 

In the same way, a variable in dynamic typing can hold different types of data during runtime, without you having to specify its type ahead of time. 

Some things to remember about Dynamic Typing include:

- We don't need to declare a variable's type ahead of time
- The type of data stored in a variable can change during runtime
- This can make code more flexible and easier to write and read
