# Lossy Compression

**Lossy Compression**

Lossy Compression is a technique used in computer science to reduce the size of a file by permanently removing some of the data that is not important or less important, and sometimes substituting it with an approximation of the original data. Here is how you can think of it:

* Lossy compression is like a game of guess who. 
* Imagine that you want to keep some pictures on your phone or computer, but these pictures take up a lot of space. 
* To save space, you can pick some pictures that you aren't too worried about losing some detail from, like the thumbnail copies of a picture. 
* Together with a computer algorithm, the picture is evaluated for the less important data, removing or approximating details like color information or noise. This is like guessing and removing the parts that don't matter compared to the ones that do. 
* The resulting new file may not look or sound exactly like the original file, but it will be much smaller, taking up less space on your computer or phone.

Lossy compression is often used for media files, like sound and images, and can greatly reduce file sizes without impacting the perceived quality. Examples of lossy compression formats include JPEG for images, and MP3 or AAC for sound.
