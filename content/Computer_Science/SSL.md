# SSL

SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. It is a type of security protocol used to protect data sent over the internet. It works by encrypting the data before it is sent, so that only the sender and receiver can access it. It also provides authentication, which means that the sender and receiver can be sure that the data is coming from a legitimate source. SSL makes it difficult for hackers to intercept or modify the data, making it a secure way to send sensitive information over the internet.
