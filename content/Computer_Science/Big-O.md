# Big-O

Big-O is a way of measuring how efficient a computer program is. It looks at how much time and memory it takes for a program to run. It looks at the number of operations (or steps) that need to be done to complete the task. Big-O is usually written as a number followed by an 'O'. The lower the number, the more efficient the program is. For example, if a program takes 10 steps to complete, it would be written as 'O(10)'. Big-O is a way to measure the complexity of a program, so that we can make sure that our programs run quickly and efficiently.
