# AJAX

AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**. It is a way to send and receive information from a web server without having to reload the entire web page. 

Using AJAX, a web page can request data from the server and display it without having to reload the entire page. This makes the web page faster and more responsive. For example, when you type something into a search box, the page can send a request to the server and get back the results without having to reload the page. 

AJAX is made up of three main components: HTML and CSS to structure and style the page, JavaScript to make the request and manipulate the data, and XML to format the data. Together, these components allow a web page to request and receive data from a server without having to reload the page.
