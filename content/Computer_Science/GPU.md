# GPU

A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a special part of a computer that helps a lot with pictures and videos. 

* Just like how you use your eyes to look at pictures, a computer uses a GPU to show things on the screen.
* When you watch a video on YouTube or play a video game, the GPU makes sure that the pictures move smoothly and look really nice.
* The GPU is really good at doing lots of calculations quickly, which is important for making sure the pictures and videos look good.
* A computer can have more than one GPU, which can make it even faster at showing pictures and videos.
* Some people use a GPU for other things too, like math or science, because it can do calculations really quickly.
* But just like with anything else, if you use the GPU too much, it can get really hot and might need a break.
