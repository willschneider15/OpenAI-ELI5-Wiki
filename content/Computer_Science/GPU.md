# GPU

GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit. It is a type of processor that is used to quickly process graphical data for computer games, videos, and other visual media. It works by dividing the data into smaller pieces, which can be processed more quickly. This allows for faster, more realistic visuals. GPUs are also used for other tasks such as machine learning and scientific computing. They are more powerful than a regular CPU because they can process multiple tasks at once. GPUs are becoming increasingly popular in computing due to their ability to speed up complex tasks.
