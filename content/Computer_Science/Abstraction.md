# Abstraction

Abstraction in Computer Science is a concept which allows us to focus on what we want to do, instead of how we want to do it. This means we can work with something without knowing exactly how it works. 

- Abstraction enables us to hide details that are not important for our current task, and only focus on what is important.
- It allows us to simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- For example, when we use a computer, we are using an abstraction of complex electrical circuits and software, which makes it easy for us to interact with the device.
- Abstraction is used in coding, where developers group related data and functions into abstract classes, which can then be used by other developers without needing to know the details of how the class works.
- Abstraction is particularly useful in Object Oriented Programming, where developers can create abstract classes and then create subclasses that inherit the functionality of the parent class. 
- Overall, abstraction is a powerful tool for simplifying complex systems and making it easier for people to work with them.
