# Brute Force

Brute force is a technique used to solve problems by trying every possible solution until one works. It is like a guessing game where you try every combination of numbers and letters until you find the right answer. To do this, you have to have a list of all possible solutions and then try each one until you find the one that works. Brute force is used in computer science to solve problems like finding passwords or solving complex algorithms. It is an effective technique, but it can take a long time to find the right answer.
