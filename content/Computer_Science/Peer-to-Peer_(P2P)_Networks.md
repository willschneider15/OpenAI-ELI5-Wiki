# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are a type of computer network where each computer or device in the network has the same level of access and responsibility. In a P2P network, computers are able to connect with one another and share files directly between themselves, without any intermediary servers. P2P networks are used for file sharing, communication, and other applications.

* In simpler terms, it's when you and your friends all bring your toys to play together.
* In a P2P network, nobody is the "boss" - everyone shares and downloads files. 
* P2P networks were popularized in the early days of the internet by file-sharing software like Napster and LimeWire.
* While P2P networks are still commonly used for file sharing, they can also be used for other applications, such as online gaming and distributed computing.
* P2P networks provide a decentralized approach to networking, which can make them more resilient to failure and more difficult to censor or shut down.
