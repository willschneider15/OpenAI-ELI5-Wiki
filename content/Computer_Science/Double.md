# Double

In computer programming, we often need to work with different kinds of numbers. One of the types of numbers we can use is called a "double."

A double is a way to represent a number that has a decimal point in it. It's like having a money box where you can put in some coins (like quarters or dimes) as well as some dollar bills. The coins can represent the decimal part of the number (like the cents) while the dollar bills represent the whole number (like the dollars).

Here are some key points to remember about doubles:

* A double is a type of variable in programming that can hold a number with a decimal point.
* Doubles are useful for working with numbers that have a fractional component.
* Doubles use more memory than integers because they allow for more precision in numbers.
* You can perform math operations on doubles just like any other numeric variable.
* To declare a double in programming, you would use the word "double" followed by the variable name. For example: `double myDouble = 3.14;`

Hopefully, this explanation helped you understand what a double is and how it can be useful in programming!
