# Double

Double is a type of data used in computers. It is a way of representing numbers that are very large or very small. Double is short for double-precision floating-point. This means that the number can be very small (like 0.000000001) or very large (like 100,000,000,000). 

Double is made up of two parts: a mantissa and an exponent. The mantissa is the part that stores the digits of the number. The exponent is the part that tells the computer how big or small the number is. The exponent can be positive or negative. 

For example, if the mantissa is 123 and the exponent is 3, then the number is 123,000. If the mantissa is 0.123 and the exponent is -3, then the number is 0.000123. 

Double is used in computers because it allows the computer to represent numbers that are very large or very small. This is important for scientific calculations and other calculations that require very precise numbers.
