# Inheritance

Inheritance is a concept in programming where one object can use the properties and methods of another object. It's like having a blueprint for a house and then using that blueprint to build a bigger house. The bigger house has all the same features as the original house, but is bigger and has more features.

In programming, inheritance works in a similar way. The object that is being inherited from is called the parent object, and the object that is inheriting the properties and methods is called the child object. The child object has all the same properties and methods as the parent object, but can also have additional properties and methods.

Inheritance is a great way to write code that is efficient and reusable. By using inheritance, you can write code that is easier to read, easier to maintain, and easier to debug.
