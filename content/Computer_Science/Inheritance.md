# Inheritance

Inheritance is like when you get traits from your parents. In Computer Science, you can create a new class that is similar to another class, but has some differences. Instead of starting from scratch and recreating everything, you can use inheritance to borrow the traits from the original class. Here are some things you should know about it:

- The original class is called the parent or base class. The new class is called the child or derived class.
- The child class has access to all of the attributes and methods of the parent class.
- The child class can add new attributes and methods or even override existing ones.
- Inheritance helps to simplify code and make it easier to read and understand.
- It also allows for code reusability, as you can create new classes without having to start from scratch each time.

Overall, inheritance is a useful tool for creating new classes that are similar to existing ones. It allows for code reuse, simplifies programming, and makes it easier to manage large and complex programs.
