# string

A string is a bunch of letters, numbers or other little symbols that we can save on our computer so we don't forget them. It is like beads on a necklace or different coloured crayons in a box. Here are some key points to remember:

- Strings are made up of individual characters, like the letters of the alphabet.
- We can use strings to represent words or sentences.
- We can manipulate strings by adding them together or changing individual characters.
- Strings are surrounded by quotation marks so the computer knows we are talking about text and not code.
- Strings can be used in many different computer programs, like games, messaging apps or social media platforms.

As you learn more about computer science, you'll see that strings are a really important part of programming!
