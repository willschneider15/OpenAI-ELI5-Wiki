# Command Line Interface

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way of talking to your computer by typing words and seeing text responses. It is like a special language that you can use to control your computer. Here's what you need to know:

* A CLI is a program you can open on your computer to interact with the computer using text input and output.
* You interact with the CLI by typing commands that tell the computer what to do.
* When you type a command and press "Enter," the computer reads the command and does what you told it to do.
* CLI commands can be used to navigate through files on your computer, run programs, automate processes, and more.
* While the CLI can be intimidating at first, it is a very powerful tool for computer programmers and system administrators.
