# Scrum

Scrum is a way for a team to work together to create something. Here is how it works:

1. The team (which is made up of a bunch of people) gets together and decides what they need to build.
2. They break the bigger thing into smaller pieces that they can work on one at a time.
3. They decide which pieces they will work on during a time period called a Sprint (usually two to four weeks).
4. Every day, the team meets to talk about what they worked on the day before and what they will work on that day.
5. At the end of the Sprint, the team gets together and shows what they made to other people who might want to use it.
6. Then they start all over again, deciding what to work on next.

Scrum helps teams work better because:

* Everyone knows what they are supposed to be doing.
* Everyone talks to each other every day, so no one is surprised by what someone else is doing.
* The team can change what they are working on if they need to, so they always make the most important thing first.
