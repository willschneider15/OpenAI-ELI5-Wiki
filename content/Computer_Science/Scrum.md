# Scrum

Scrum is a method of organizing work in small, manageable chunks. It is often used in software development, but can be used for any kind of project.

In Scrum, a project is broken down into small pieces called "sprints." Each sprint is a set amount of time, usually two weeks, during which a team works on a particular task or set of tasks. At the end of each sprint, the team reviews their progress and decides what to do next. This helps keep the project on track and ensures that all tasks are completed in a timely manner.

Scrum also involves regular meetings, such as daily stand-up meetings, where team members discuss progress and any problems they may have encountered. This helps the team stay focused and on track.

Overall, Scrum is a great way to organize and manage a project. It helps keep everyone on the same page and makes sure the project is completed on time.
