# Machine Translation

Machine Translation (MT) is a process that helps people to translate text or speech from one language to another. It is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms to automatically convert one language into another. 

In MT, a computer program is used to analyze the source language and produce a translation in the target language. The computer program breaks the source language into small pieces and then uses special rules to translate each piece into the target language. It is a fast and efficient way to translate large amounts of text.

MT is used in many different fields, such as translating websites, books, and other documents. It can also be used to help people communicate with people who speak different languages. It is becoming increasingly important as the world becomes more connected and globalized.
