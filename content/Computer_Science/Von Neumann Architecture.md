# Von Neumann Architecture

Von Neumann Architecture is a type of computer architecture, named after mathematician and computer scientist John Von Neumann. It is composed of four main components: the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory, Input Devices, and Output Devices.

The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, it is responsible for carrying out instructions. Memory is the place where data is stored and instructions are held. Input devices are used to get data into the computer, such as a keyboard or mouse. Output devices show the results of the instructions carried out by the CPU, such as a monitor or printer.

The CPU and memory are connected, allowing the CPU to access the instructions and data stored in memory. The input and output devices are also connected to the CPU, allowing the CPU to receive data from the input devices and send instructions to the output devices. This architecture allows the computer to run instructions in a linear, step-by-step fashion.
