# System Testing

System Testing is like the final test for a computer program. It's like when you take a big test at the end of a school year after you've learned everything. It checks to make sure the program works correctly and meets all the requirements. 

Here's how it works:
- A group of testers use the program to do many different things, like clicking buttons and typing in information.
- They try to break the program by doing things that normal users might not do. For example, they might enter really long words or push buttons very quickly.
- The testers check to see if there are any problems, like errors or crashes.
- If problems are found, they are sent back to the programmers to be fixed.
- Once all the problems are fixed, the program is ready to be used by everyone! 

System Testing is really important because it makes sure the program is reliable and safe to use.
