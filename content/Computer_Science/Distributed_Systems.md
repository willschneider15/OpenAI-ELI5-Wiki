# Distributed Systems

A *Distributed System* is like several kids building a LEGO set together instead of just one. Instead of just one kid creating a huge LEGO set, multiple kids might each do smaller parts of it, and then those different parts get put together to make the complete set. 

It is a computer system made up of many separate computers or servers, that work together to solve a problem. 

The main idea is to complete tasks faster and more efficiently, like a group project at school. 

In a Distributed System, each computer works together with the others to complete a task or solve a problem, rather than on their own. 

There are many benefits of having a Distributed System, such as: 

- Improved performance 
- Increased reliability 
- Increased scalability, so you can easily add more computers as needed 
- Better fault tolerance, which means that if one computer fails, the others can keep working 

Overall, Distributed Systems are a really cool way of getting lots of computers to work together, like a team.
