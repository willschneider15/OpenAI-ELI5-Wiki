# Context Switch

Context Switching is like changing gears in a car. It's when a computer system changes from one task to another. When a computer is doing one task, it's in one "context", or environment. When it switches to another task, it has to change contexts. This means it has to save the state of the first task and then load the state of the second task. This is so the computer knows what it was doing and can pick up where it left off. Context Switching is important because it allows the computer to do multiple tasks at the same time.
