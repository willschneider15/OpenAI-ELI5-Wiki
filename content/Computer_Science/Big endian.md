# Big endian

Big Endian is a way of storing data. It is the opposite of Little Endian. In Big Endian, the most significant byte (the byte containing the most information) is stored first, followed by the next most significant byte, and so on. For example, if a number is stored as a 4-byte integer, the most significant byte would be stored first, followed by the next most significant byte, and so on. This means that when reading the data, the most significant byte is read first. Big Endian is used in many computer systems, including the IBM System/360, the PowerPC processor, and the Motorola 68000 processor. It is also used in network protocols such as IPv4 and TCP/IP. Big Endian is often used in data storage and transmission, as it simplifies the process of reading and writing data.
