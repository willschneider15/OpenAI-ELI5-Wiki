# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is a way of understanding how people feel about something by looking at the words they say. It can help us understand how people feel about a product, service, or topic.

To do sentiment analysis, we use special computer programs that look at words and phrases and try to understand what people are saying. The computer looks for words that are positive, like “great” or “amazing”, or words that are negative, like “bad” or “terrible”. It then counts up how many positive and negative words it finds and gives us a score that tells us how people feel about the thing we are looking at.

Sentiment Analysis is used in many different industries, such as marketing, customer service, and healthcare. It can help companies understand how their customers feel about their products and services, and it can help healthcare providers understand how their patients feel about their care.
