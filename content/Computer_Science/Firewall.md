# Firewall

A firewall is a type of security system that prevents unauthorized access to a computer or network. It works like a wall, blocking intruders from entering. It is like a guard that stands between your computer and the internet, controlling what information can enter and leave the computer. 

A firewall can be either hardware or software. Hardware firewalls are physical devices installed between your computer and the internet. Software firewalls are programs installed on your computer that can be configured to block certain types of data. 

Firewalls can be used to protect your computer from malicious attacks and to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. They can also be used to filter out unwanted content such as spam and viruses. Firewalls are an important tool for keeping your computer and data safe.
