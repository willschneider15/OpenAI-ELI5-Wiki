# Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used to protect accounts and data. It requires two different forms of authentication before access is granted. 

The first form of authentication can be something you know, like a password or PIN. The second form of authentication can be something you have, like a security token or your mobile phone. 

When you try to access an account or data, you will be asked to provide both forms of authentication. This helps to make sure that it is really you who is trying to access the account or data. 

2FA is becoming increasingly popular as it makes it much harder for someone to gain access to your account or data if they don't have both forms of authentication. It's an important security measure that everyone should use to protect their accounts and data.
