# Reference

Reference is a way of referring to something without having to make a copy of it. It's like a shortcut to something that already exists. 

For example, if you have a list of numbers, you could make a reference to the list instead of copying it. That way, if you change the list, all the references to it will be updated automatically.

Another example is a computer program. It can have a reference to a piece of data, such as a variable or an array, that is stored in memory. That way, the program can use the data without having to make a copy of it.

References are useful because they save time, memory, and processing power. They also make it easier to keep track of data and make sure it is up to date.
