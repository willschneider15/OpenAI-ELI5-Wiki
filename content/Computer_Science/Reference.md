# Reference

Reference is a way for a computer to remember something without copying it. Instead of making a duplicate, it simply points to the original thing.

* When you draw a picture, you can make a copy of it by tracing over it.
* When a computer wants to remember something, it can duplicate it by making a copy of it in memory.
* But sometimes that can take up a lot of space.
* Instead, a computer can make a reference to something.
* A reference is like pointing at something and saying "remember this".
* That way the computer doesn't have to make a duplicate.
* References are useful because they allow different parts of a program to share things like data or objects.
