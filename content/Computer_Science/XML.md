# XML

XML stands for "Extensible Markup Language". It is used for various purposes, such as storing and transporting data, or representing structures that can be used by other programming languages or tools.

* XML is like a set of labels which describe how data should be organized.
* It tells a computer how to display the data, much like how a recipe tells someone how to cook a dish.
* These labels are written in a specific way so that a computer can easily understand and follow them.
* Think of XML like a fancy grocery list, where each item has a set of instructions on how it should be used and prepared.
* XML is particularly useful because it is flexible and can be customized to meet specific needs.
* It is often used for web pages, documents, and databases.
* For example, an online store could use XML to display a list of products, and a customer could use it to place an order.
