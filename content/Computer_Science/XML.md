# XML

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used to store and transfer data between computers. It is similar to HTML, but it is used to store data instead of displaying it visually. 

XML is made up of tags that are used to store and transfer data. Each tag is like a label that tells the computer what kind of information is contained within it. For example, a tag might say "<person>", and the information inside the tag might be the name, age and address of the person.

XML is a great way to store and transfer data because it is very flexible and can be used to store any kind of data. It is also easy to use and understand, and it can be read by any computer.
