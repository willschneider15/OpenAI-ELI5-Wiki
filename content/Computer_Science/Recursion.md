# Recursion

Recursion is a way of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces. It's like a puzzle that you can solve by taking it apart and putting it back together. Think of it like a tower of blocks. To solve the puzzle, you have to take each block apart one at a time until you reach the bottom. Then you have to put the blocks back together in the same order.

Recursion is a way of solving a problem by repeating the same steps over and over again until you reach the solution. For example, if you want to calculate the factorial of a number, you can use recursion to do it. You start with the number and then multiply it by one less than the number. Then you take the result and multiply it by one less than that number. You keep going until you reach 1. The result is the factorial of the number.
