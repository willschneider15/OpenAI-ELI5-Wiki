# Recursion

**Recursion** is a process of repeating things over and over again until we get an answer or outcome.

* Here's an example: imagine you want to count the number of bowls in a stack of bowls.
* You could count them one by one, or you could use recursion by taking one bowl out at a time and counting the rest of the bowls.
* Once you reach a single bowl, the total number of bowls is simply one, and you can add up that result to arrive at the total number of bowls in the stack.
* Similarly, in programming, a method can call itself within its own code, repeatedly performing some operation until it reaches a base condition, and then returning the result back to the original method call.
* Recursion can help make programs shorter, simpler, and easier to understand.
* However, it can also be dangerous if it is not properly implemented or if the base condition is never reached, leading to a so-called stack overflow error.
