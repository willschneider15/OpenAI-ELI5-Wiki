# Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a magic internet that your device can access without using any cables. 

- Have you ever used a walkie-talkie? Wi-Fi works in a similar way, except instead of talking to someone directly, you're sending information to a little box called a modem.
- The modem is connected to the internet with a cable, and it sends this internet magic through the air to your device. 
- Once your device and the modem are connected, they can talk to each other and share information. 
- Wi-Fi is very handy because you can use the internet anywhere in the room without needing to be near the modem with a cable. 
- It's like having magic internet that follows you around! 

Remember to ask your parents before connecting to Wi-Fi that you're not familiar with, because not all magic is good magic.
