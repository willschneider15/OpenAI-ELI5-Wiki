# Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is a way to connect to the internet without using cables. It works by using radio waves to send information between two devices, such as your computer and the internet. 

Your computer or other device (like a phone or tablet) has a Wi-Fi card inside it that can pick up the radio waves sent out by a router. The router is connected to the internet and sends out the radio waves. When your Wi-Fi card picks up the waves, it can use them to connect to the internet. 

Once connected, you can do all sorts of things like browse the web, watch videos, play games, and more. You don't have to worry about plugging in cables or dealing with wires - it's all done with radio waves!
