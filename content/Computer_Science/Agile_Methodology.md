# Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is like building a LEGO castle! 

* Just like how you start by building small sections of the castle (like the walls or the tower one by one), in Agile methodology you also break up the work into smaller chunks. 

* This way, it's easier to see progress being made and to address issues as they arise. 

* As the castle grows, you might decide that a section needs to be refactored or redesigned. Similarly, in Agile methodology, you regularly review the work being done and make changes if needed. 

* Also, since building a LEGO castle requires teamwork, so does Agile methodology. The team is constantly communicating, making adjustments, and continuously building upon what theyâ€™ve already completed. 

So just like how building a LEGO castle piece by piece can result in a big, beautiful final product, Agile methodology encourages completing small tasks that lead to making a quality end product that meets the needs of the client!
