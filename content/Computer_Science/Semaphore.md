# Semaphore

A semaphore is a way for multiple processes to communicate with each other. It is like a flag that is used to indicate if a resource is available or not. The flag can be either red (not available) or green (available). When a process needs to use a resource, it checks the semaphore to see if the resource is available. If it is, the process can use the resource. If it isn't, the process has to wait until the resource is available. Semaphores are useful for preventing processes from accessing resources at the same time, which can cause problems.
