# Semaphore

A semaphore is like a traffic signal for computer programs. It helps different programs or threads share resources without conflicts. 

* Imagine you have a toy box with only one car and two kids who want to play with it. If they both grab the toy at the same time, there will be a fight. 
* A semaphore can be used to control access to the toy box. It allows one kid to play with the car at a time. 
* When the first kid wants to play with the car, they signal the semaphore by pressing a button. This lets the semaphore know they want to use the toy. 
* The semaphore checks to see if the toy is available. If it is, it will give the first kid permission to play with the car. 
* While the first kid is playing with the car, the semaphore will not allow the second kid to grab it. 
* Once the first kid is done playing, they release the semaphore and the second kid can then have a turn. 

In short, a semaphore helps to avoid conflicts between programs or threads that are accessing shared resources.
