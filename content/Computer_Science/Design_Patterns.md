# Design Patterns

Design patterns are like recipes that help us make yummy cakes. There are many different types of cakes, but each one has some common steps that we follow while baking them. In the same way, design patterns are common solutions to common problems we face while creating software.

Some examples of design patterns are:

* **Singleton** - This pattern helps us make sure that we only have one instance of a class in our program.
* **Factory Method** - This pattern helps us create objects without having to specify the exact type of object we want to create.
* **Observer** - This pattern helps us notify a set of objects whenever the state of another object changes.

Design patterns are useful because they help us write code that is:

* **Reusable** - Once we've created a class or function using a design pattern, we can reuse it in different parts of our program.
* **Readable** - Because design patterns are common solutions, other programmers can easily understand what our code is doing.
* **Testable** - By breaking our code into smaller, more modular components, we can more easily test each component separately.
