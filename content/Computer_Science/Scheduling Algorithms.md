# Scheduling Algorithms

Scheduling algorithms are used to determine how computer processes are organized and executed. They decide which processes should run first and for how long. They help to maximize the efficiency of the computer by making sure that the most important tasks are completed first. Scheduling algorithms can also help to minimize the amount of time that a process takes to complete, as well as to ensure that all processes are completed in a timely manner. The most common scheduling algorithms are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR). FCFS assigns processes to the CPU in the order that they arrive, while SJF assigns processes based on the amount of time they will take to complete. Finally, RR assigns processes to the CPU in a circular fashion, with each process getting a fixed time slice.
