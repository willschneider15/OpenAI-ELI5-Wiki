# Computer Vision

Computer vision is the ability of a computer to recognize and understand images and videos. It is a field of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to process and analyze digital images and videos.

Computer vision works by analyzing the images and videos, breaking them down into individual components such as pixels, shapes, and colors. It can then compare these components to a database of known objects, and identify the objects in the image.

Computer vision can be used in a variety of ways, such as facial recognition, object recognition, and motion analysis. It can also be used to detect objects in a scene and track them over time.

Computer vision is becoming increasingly important in the world today, as it can be used for a variety of applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and surveillance.
