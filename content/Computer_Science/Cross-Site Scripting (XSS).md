# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability that occurs when a malicious script is injected into an otherwise legitimate website. It can be used to steal user data, hijack user accounts, or even perform malicious actions on the website.

XSS works by exploiting vulnerabilities in the websiteâ€™s code. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to inject malicious code into the website. This code can then be used to access private user information, steal cookies, or even redirect users to malicious websites.

XSS can be prevented by using secure coding practices and input validation. Secure coding practices involve writing code that is robust and secure, while input validation is a process of ensuring that user input is valid and not malicious.

By taking these steps, websites can protect themselves from XSS attacks and keep their users safe.
