# Regression Testing

Regression testing is like checking if the cookie recipe worked just as well as last time.

 Here's a breakdown of what that means:

- When you make cookies, you use a recipe to know what ingredients you need and how to mix them together. 
- When you make changes to the recipe, you want to make sure that the cookies still taste good, right? That's exactly what regression testing does! 
- If you make changes to a program's code, it's important to make sure that everything still works as expected after you make the updates. 
- That's where regression testing comes in. It is the process of testing a program after it has been modified to make sure that changes haven't caused errors or problems in other parts of the program. 
- Just like how you might taste test cookies to make sure that they still taste good, we use regression testing to make sure that our program still works correctly after changes are made.
