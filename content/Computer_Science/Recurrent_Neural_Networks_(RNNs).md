# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

A Recurrent Neural Network or RNN is a type of Artificial Intelligence that's inspired by how our brains work. To better understand what a RNN is, consider the following example:

Imagine you're listening to music and trying to predict what the next note will be. You don't just listen to each note independently, you also listen to the notes that came before it. This is exactly how a RNN works; it processes data sequentially and remembers things through time.

RNNs are commonly used in applications such as text prediction, language translation, speech recognition, and music composition. Some other key features of RNNs include:

- They can process variable-length sequences of data.
- They have a 'memory' or 'state' that gets updated every time new data is processed.
- They can learn to recognize patterns in sequences of data and predict what comes next.
- They are made up of interconnected 'neurons' that allow information to flow through the network.

Overall, RNNs are powerful tools that can help us solve a wide range of problems by learning from sequential data and recognizing patterns over time.
