# Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a type of code used to prove that a message or document is from a specific person or organization. It works by encrypting the document or message with a special code. When the recipient receives the message, they can use the code to verify that it came from the sender. Digital signatures are important because they help to ensure that the message or document is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. They also provide an extra layer of security, as the code is unique and can't be replicated. Digital signatures are used in many areas, from financial transactions to medical records. They are also used to verify the identity of a user before allowing access to a system.
