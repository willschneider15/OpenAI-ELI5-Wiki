# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial intelligence that can recognize patterns in images and videos. They work by taking an image, breaking it into small pieces, and then analyzing each piece to find patterns. The patterns are then used to classify the image into a certain category. For example, a CNN might be used to identify a dog in an image. The CNN would look at the image, break it into pieces, and look for patterns that are associated with a dog. Once it finds the patterns, it can classify the image as a dog.
