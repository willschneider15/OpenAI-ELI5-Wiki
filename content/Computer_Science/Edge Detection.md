# Edge Detection

Edge detection is a method used to identify the boundaries of objects in an image. It works by looking for rapid changes in brightness or color in the image and using those changes to identify the edges of the objects. Edge detection can be used to identify the edges of objects in a picture, like the outline of a person or a building. It is also used in computer vision and robotics for tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Edge detection can be done manually, but it is often done automatically with a computer program.
