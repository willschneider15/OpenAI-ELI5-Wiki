# DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is like a phone book for the internet. It helps connect a website's name, like www.example.com, to its IP address, like 192.168.1.1. 

When you type a website address into your browser, the DNS looks up the IP address associated with the website name. Then it sends your browser the IP address so your browser can find the website.

DNS is like a big directory of website names and their associated IP addresses. It is like a map that helps you find the right website when you type in a website name.
