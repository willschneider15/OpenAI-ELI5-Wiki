# DNS

DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, is like a phone book for the internet. Just like a phone book helps you find a phone number for a person or business, DNS helps your computer find a website on the internet. 

Here's how it works:

* When you type in a website name (like google.com), your computer doesn't know where to find it on the internet.
* It asks a DNS server for help.
* The DNS server looks up the website's IP address (a unique set of numbers that identifies where the website is located).
* Once the DNS server finds the IP address, it sends it back to your computer.
* Your computer uses that information to connect to the website and show it to you on your screen.

In summary, DNS is a system that helps your computer find the right website on the internet by translating website names into their unique IP addresses.
