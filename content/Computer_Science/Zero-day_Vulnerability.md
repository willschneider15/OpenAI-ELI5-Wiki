# Zero-day Vulnerability

Zero-day vulnerability refers to a computer security issue that is not yet known to the public or software developers. This vulnerability can be exploited by hackers to perform malicious actions such as stealing data or taking control of a computer system. Here are a few points to help better understand zero-day vulnerability:

- It is called "zero-day" because the software developers have had zero days to fix the issue.

- This type of vulnerability is very dangerous because there are no patches or solutions available.

- Hackers use zero-day vulnerabilities to perform advanced cyber attacks.

- It can take weeks or even months before a zero-day vulnerability is discovered.

- Once discovered, software developers will work on creating a patch or fix to address the issue.

- Cybersecurity researchers work to identify and report vulnerabilities to help prevent attacks.

As a computer science student, it's important to always practice good cybersecurity habits and stay up-to-date on the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
