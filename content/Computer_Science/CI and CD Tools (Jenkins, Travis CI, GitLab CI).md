# CI and CD Tools (Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI)

CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of integrating new code into a shared repository frequently. This allows developers to detect and fix bugs quickly. CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI and GitLab CI help automate the process of integrating code and testing it.

CD (Continuous Delivery) is the practice of releasing new versions of software quickly and reliably. The goal is to ensure that the software can be released at any time. CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They also provide a way to track the progress of the release process.

In summary, CI and CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitLab CI help automate the process of integrating code, testing it, and releasing new versions of software quickly and reliably. They help developers detect and fix bugs quickly, and provide a way to track the progress of the release process.
