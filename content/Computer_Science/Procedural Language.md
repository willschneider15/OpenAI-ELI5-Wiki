# Procedural Language

Procedural language is a type of programming language that tells a computer what to do, step by step. It is like giving a set of directions to the computer. It is like giving a set of instructions to the computer. Each step is a procedure, and it tells the computer what action to take. The computer follows the instructions in a specific order, like a recipe. It can do simple tasks like adding two numbers or more complex tasks like creating a webpage. Procedural languages are great for tasks that require a lot of repetition and calculations. They can also be used to create games and other interactive programs. With procedural languages, you can create programs that can be used over and over again.
