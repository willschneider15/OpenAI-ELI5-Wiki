# LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a technology that allows devices to talk to each other over long distances without using a lot of power. Imagine you and your friend live across the street from each other, and you both have walkie talkies. If you use your walkie talkie to talk to your friend, they can hear you clearly. But if you try to use it to talk to someone else who lives three blocks away, they might not be able to hear you because the walkie talkie doesn't have enough power to send the signal that far. That's where LoRaWAN comes in. 

Here's how it works:

- LoRaWAN devices use very small amounts of power, so they can send signals over long distances without using up too much energy. 
- The signals are sent through the air, like radio waves. 
- These signals are received by gateways, which are like antennas that can pick up the signals and send them to the internet. 
- Once the signals are on the internet, they can be used to send messages, control things like lights or sensors, or do other cool stuff!

So think of LoRaWAN like a walkie talkie that can talk to your friend three blocks away, but instead of a walkie talkie, it's a tiny computer that doesn't use much power, and instead of your friend, it's a gateway that sends the signal to the internet where it can be used for all sorts of things!
