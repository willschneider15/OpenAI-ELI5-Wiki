# LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a wireless communication technology that enables long-range, low-power communication between devices. It is an open standard that is designed to be used with low-power, battery-powered devices such as sensors, trackers, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It operates on the sub-gigahertz frequency bands, which allows it to transmit data over long distances with low power consumption. The technology is based on the LoRa modulation technique, which uses a spread spectrum technique to send data over a wide range of frequencies. This enables the data to be transmitted over long distances with low power consumption. LoRaWAN also uses a star network topology, which allows the devices to communicate with a central gateway. This gateway is responsible for relaying the data to the cloud, where it can be processed and analyzed. In summary, LoRaWAN is a wireless communication technology that enables long-range, low-power communication between devices, and is used for IoT applications.
