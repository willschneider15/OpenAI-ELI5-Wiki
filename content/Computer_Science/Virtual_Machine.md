# Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine is like a magic box that can create computers inside of it. Here's how it works:

* You have one physical computer, like the one you're using right now. This is your "host" computer.
* Inside the host computer, you can create a virtual machine. This is like a "computer inside a computer."
* The virtual machine has its own operating system, just like a regular computer does.
* You can install programs and files on the virtual machine, just like you would on a regular computer.
* When you're done using the virtual machine, you can close it and go back to your host computer. The virtual machine basically disappears, and everything you did inside of it is saved.
* You can start the virtual machine up again later and pick up where you left off.

Some reasons why you might use a virtual machine:

* To run multiple operating systems on one physical computer
* To test out software without affecting your host computer
* To create a "sandbox" environment for testing or experimentation
* To use specialized software that only works on certain operating systems.
