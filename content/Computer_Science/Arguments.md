# Arguments

Arguments are like telling a computer what to do by giving it specific instructions. 

* Imagine asking a friend to hand you a book. You might say "Hand me that book on the table." In computer language, "Hand me that book on the table" is an **instruction** or **command**. 
* Now imagine asking a computer to do something for you. You might say "Open Microsoft Word and create a new document." In computer language, "Open Microsoft Word and create a new document" is an **instruction** or **command**. 
* But there's more to it than just giving a computer a broad command. Sometimes you need to give computers more specific **details** or **directions**. 
* These specifics are called **arguments**. Examples of arguments might be which folder to create the new Word document in, what name to give the document, or what font and size to use. 
* Think of arguments like filling in the blanks in a form or a Mad Libs game. The overall command is there, but you need to give specific information for it to work correctly.
