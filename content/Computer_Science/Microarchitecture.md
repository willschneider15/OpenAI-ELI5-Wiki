# Microarchitecture

Microarchitecture is how a computer's insides work, like how food goes through our bodies.

* A computer has many tiny parts that have to work together to do things like browse the internet or play games.
* Just like how our mouths chew food and our stomachs break it down, the computer's microarchitecture breaks down tasks so it can do them.
* Each part of the computer has a specific job, just like how our hearts pump blood and our brains think.
* The microarchitecture is like a map for the computer's insides, telling each part what to do and how to do it.
* When everything works together correctly, the computer can do amazing things!
