# Nodes and Edges

Nodes and Edges are the basic building blocks of graphs. A graph is a mathematical concept that helps to solve complex problems. Imagine a graph is a map with a bunch of points, called nodes, and some lines, called edges, that connect these points.

* **Nodes** are represented by dots or circles
    * Imagine them as islands in a map
    * They are the objects or vertices of the graph
    * They can have labels or attributes
    * For example, nodes can be cities, people or computers

* **Edges** are represented by lines or arrows
    * They connect the nodes or vertices
    * Imagine them as the bridges or tunnels that connect the islands
    * They can have a direction or not
    * They can have a weight or cost associated with them
    * For example, edges can be roads, friendships, or network connections

Nodes and edges help represent relationships between objects, which can be used to solve many problems such as:

* Finding the shortest path between two points in a map
* Modeling social networks or friendships
* Representing computer networks 
* Organizing data in a hierarchical structure
