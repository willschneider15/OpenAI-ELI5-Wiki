# Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is delivering updates to an application or website automatically, as soon as they are ready, without requiring human intervention. This is the package of an application that contains its code, dependencies, and configurations.

Here are some key points to understand about Continuous Deployment:

* The goal is to get new features or fixes in front of users as soon as possible.
* Automated testing and quality checks are used to ensure updates are safe to deploy.
* Deployment can happen multiple times per day.
* The process includes building, testing, and releasing updated code.
* Continuous Deployment can offer faster iteration and more frequent updates for users.
* It requires a reliable infrastructure and a strong culture of automation and collaboration within a development team.

Overall, Continuous Deployment helps ensure that end-users have access to the latest and most stable version of an application or website without having to wait for manual updates from the development team.
