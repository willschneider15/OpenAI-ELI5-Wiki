# Web Servers

A **web server** is a big computer that controls a website. Think of it like a restaurant where you're the customer, and the web server is the waiter. Some important things a web server does include:

- Keeping track of all the pages of a website
- Serving those pages to you when you visit the website
- Making sure that all the pages load quickly and properly
- Managing lots of people visiting the website at the same time

Without a web server, you wouldn't be able to see or interact with any websites on the Internet. It's what makes everything work behind the scenes so that you can enjoy all the fun things you do online!

Remember that web servers aren't the same as websites themselves, just like how the restaurant and the waiter aren't the same. However, they're both important and work together to make sure you have a great experience.
