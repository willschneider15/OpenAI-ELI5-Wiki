# Serverless Computing

Serverless computing refers to a cloud hosting model in which the cloud service provider manages and allocates the computing resources and automatically runs the required code on behalf of the user.

* Think of it like ordering pizza on an app, instead of buying all the ingredients, cooking it, and then eating it.
* Serverless computing allows you to focus on your application code instead of worrying about infrastructure management, scaling, and configuration.
* It is called "serverless" because the provider abstracts away the server-level infrastructure and scales the application automatically.
* The provider charges you only for the time that your code is executed, not for the idle time of the server.
* The architecture is event-driven, meaning the execution of the code happens only in response to specific triggers or events, reducing resource utilization and cost.
* Applications built using serverless computing are highly scalable, available, and fault-tolerant.
* It is best suited for applications with intermittent and unpredictable workloads, such as chatbots, IoT-enabled devices, and image processing.
