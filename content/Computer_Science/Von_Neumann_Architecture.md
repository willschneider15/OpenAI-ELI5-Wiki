# Von Neumann Architecture

Von Neumann Architecture is the basic design of most computers. It is named after John von Neumann, a renowned mathematician, and computer scientist. 

Here are some key points to remember about Von Neumann Architecture: 

* It is based on a stored-program concept, which means that both program instructions and data are stored in the same memory. 
* Von Neumann Architecture has five main components: 
  * Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  * Memory Unit
  * Input/Output Interfaces
  * System Bus
  * Secondary Storage
* The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for performing calculations and executing instructions.
* The memory unit stores information in a specific address, which allows the CPU to retrieve it later.
* The input/output interfaces allow the computer to communicate with external devices such as a keyboard, mouse or printer. 
* The system bus is a set of wires used to transmit data and instructions between the CPU, memory and input/output interfaces. 
* Secondary storage, such as a hard disk, stores data and programs that are not currently in use. 

In short, Von Neumann Architecture is an incredibly important concept in computer science because it underpins the design of most computers today, allowing them to store, process, and retrieve information efficiently.
