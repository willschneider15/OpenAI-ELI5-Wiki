# Zero-day Vulnerability

Zero-day vulnerabilities are security flaws in a computer system or application that can be exploited by cyber criminals before the software developer is even aware of it. These vulnerabilities can be used to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt a system. 

The term "zero-day" comes from the fact that the vulnerability was unknown to the developer for a period of zero days. This means that the developer had no time to fix the issue before it was exploited by malicious actors. 

Zero-day vulnerabilities can be extremely dangerous, as they can be used to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt a system. The best way to protect against these vulnerabilities is to keep all of your software up to date and to use a reputable security suite.
