# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is when hackers try to sneak their own code into a website or web application that others use. This lets the attackers steal personal information, login credentials, or even cause harm to the user's computer. 

Here is how it works:
* The attacker finds a website that is not secure, and they submit malicious code into one of the website's fields, whether that is a search bar, form, or comment box, etc.
* The website accepts the code, thinking it is legitimate, and adds the code into the website's database or display it to the user.
* The next unsuspecting user that browses to the same webpage where the malicious code has been inserted will be a victim of this attack. 

To protect yourself from this type of attack, you should:

* Be careful clicking on links or opening attachments from unknown sources.
* Use a trusted anti-virus/malware software to block potentially dangerous codes, files or links. 
* Always make sure the website you're visiting is secure, check for a green padlock or 'https' in the address bar. 
* Regularly update your device's operating system, web browser, and any installed applications.
