# ACID Properties

ACID stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**. These are four properties that all successful databases must have.

Atomicity means that all operations within a database must be atomic, meaning they must either all occur or none of them occur. This ensures that transactions are completed successfully, without any partial changes.

Consistency ensures that all transactions are valid and follow the rules of the database. It ensures that the data is consistent and accurate.

Isolation ensures that each transaction is separate and independent of any other transaction. This prevents any data from being corrupted by other transactions.

Durability ensures that all data is stored permanently and can be recovered if the system fails. This ensures that the data is safe and secure.
