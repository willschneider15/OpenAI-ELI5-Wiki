# Space Complexity

**Space complexity** is a measure of how much memory or space an algorithm needs to complete a task. Let me explain it to you by comparing it to a toy box with different toys inside it.

* Just like toys take up physical space in a toy box, some algorithms take up memory space to store and process data.
* The more complex the algorithm is, the more space it might need to complete the task.
* However, just like a toy box can have many toys but still fit nicely in a closet, an algorithm can still be space-efficient even if it needs some memory to work.

As a computer science student, you will need to be familiar with space complexity when designing algorithms to solve problems. It is important to keep space efficiency in mind when writing code since the amount of space an algorithm needs can have a significant impact on its overall performance. By optimizing space complexity, you can help ensure that your code runs faster and more efficiently, no matter what task it is performing.
