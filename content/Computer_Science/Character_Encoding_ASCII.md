# Character Encoding ASCII

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a way that computers understand letters, numbers, and symbols. It is like a secret code that only computers know how to read.

Here are the key points to keep in mind:

* ASCII assigns a unique number to each character, like 65 for "A" and 97 for "a."
* Computers use these numbers to represent characters internally.
* ASCII only uses 7 bits (0s and 1s) to represent each character. This means it can only represent 128 characters total.
* This includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and some symbols like punctuation marks and basic arithmetic operators.
* ASCII is the most basic character encoding and is still widely used today. However, it has some limitations:
  * It only supports English and other Western languages.
  * It cannot represent special characters like emojis or characters from non-Latin scripts like Chinese or Arabic.
* Today, many character encodings have been developed to support a wider range of languages and characters, but ASCII remains an important foundation for computer programming.
