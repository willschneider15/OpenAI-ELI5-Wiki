# Regression Testing

Regression Testing is a type of software testing that checks if changes made to a program have not caused any unintended effects. It is used to ensure that the changes made have not caused any bugs or errors in the program.

Regression Testing involves running tests on the program to make sure that the changes have not caused any issues. This can be done by running tests on the code, or by running tests on the program itself. The tests should be designed to check for any bugs or errors that could have been caused by the changes.

Regression Testing is important because it helps to prevent bugs and errors from being introduced into the program. It also ensures that the program works as expected after changes have been made. This helps to ensure that the program is stable and reliable.
