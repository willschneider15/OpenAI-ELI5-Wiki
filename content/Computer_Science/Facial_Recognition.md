# Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is when a computer program can identify a face by looking at its features. It's like how you know who your friends are by their face, but a computer can do it even better! Here are some things to know about facial recognition:

* A camera takes a picture of a face and stores it in a database.
* The computer analyzes the image and looks for certain things like the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the size of the mouth.
* Then, the computer compares the image to the faces in the database to find a match.
* If it finds a match, it can tell you who the person is!
* Facial recognition is used for things like security at airports, unlocking your phone, and even catching bad guys!
* It's important to use facial recognition responsibly and make sure people's privacy is protected.

So, facial recognition is when a computer looks at someone's face and figures out who they are! It's a cool technology, but we need to use it carefully.
