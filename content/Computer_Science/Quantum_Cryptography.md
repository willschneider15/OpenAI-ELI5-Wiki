# Quantum Cryptography

Quantum Cryptography is like a secret code machine that is super smart and always makes sure nobody else can read your messages, no matter how sneaky they are! Here's how it works:

* Instead of using regular numbers, we use special particles called "photons" to represent our code.
* These photons can behave in really strange ways because they follow the rules of quantum physics!
* When we send a photon to someone, we make sure to measure it first. This changes the photon in a way that only we can understand, and nobody else can copy.
* The person on the other end can receive the photon and measure it too, but they won't be able to get the same result as us.
* So, we can send secret messages using these coded photons and nobody else can read them because they won't know what measurement to take!
* Imagine if we tried to write secret messages on a piece of paper, but even if someone intercepted it, they wouldn't be able to read it because it was written in a strange, secret language that only we know!

So, no matter how clever someone is, they won't be able to read our secret messages because they won't know what measurements to take on the photons!
