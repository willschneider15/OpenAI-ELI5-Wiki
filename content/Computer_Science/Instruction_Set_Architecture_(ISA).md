# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is like a recipe book for your computer's processor. 

* It's a set of instructions that tells your computer what to do with the data it receives. 
* Just like how a recipe tells you how to cook a meal, the ISA tells the processor how to process information.
* It includes commands like "add" and "subtract" that the processor follows to carry out specific tasks. 
* Think of it like a language that the processor understands and uses to perform tasks. 
* Different processors have different ISAs, just as different recipe books have different recipes. 
* Understanding the ISA is important for computer scientists because it helps them design processors that are efficient and can carry out specific tasks effectively.
 
In summary, ISA is like a recipe book that tells the processor how to carry out specific tasks using a set of agreed-upon instructions.
