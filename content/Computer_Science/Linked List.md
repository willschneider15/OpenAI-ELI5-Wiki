# Linked List

Linked Lists are a type of data structure that stores data in a linear fashion. Each item in a Linked List is called a node, and each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. 

The nodes in a Linked List are connected like a chain, so that the tail of one node points to the head of the next node. This allows the data in the Linked List to be stored in any order. To find a specific item in the Linked List, you can start at the head node and follow the pointers until you find the item you're looking for. 

Linked Lists are useful for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly. They are also easy to modify because you can add or remove nodes without having to rearrange the data.
