# Packets

Packets are like little messages that computers send to each other over the Internet. Hereâ€™s how they work:

* When a computer wants to send a message (like a picture or an email), it breaks the message up into tiny pieces called packets.
* Each packet is like a little package that has a to and from address on it. This tells the Internet where to send it and where it came from.
* The packet also contains a piece of the original message, so when all the packets arrive at their destination, they can be put back together in the right order to recreate the original message.
* The packets are then transmitted over the Internet and can travel along different routes to get to their destination.
* When the packets arrive, they are reassembled into the original message.

Think of packets like little envelopes that have a to and from address on them, and when they all arrive at their destination, they can be put back together to create the original message.
