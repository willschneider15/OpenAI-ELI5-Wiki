# Harvard Architecture

Harvard Architecture refers to a type of computer architecture where the memory used to store data is separated from the memory used to store instructions. Basically, it's like having two different rooms in your house to store different kinds of things.

Here's what you need to know about Harvard Architecture:

- It's named after Harvard University, where the concept was first developed in the 1940s.
- It's a contrast to Von Neumann Architecture, which uses a single memory space for both instructions and data.
- A Harvard Architecture computer has separate memory spaces for instructions and data, allowing it to access both simultaneously.
- This can make a Harvard Architecture computer faster than a Von Neumann Architecture computer since it doesn't have to switch back and forth between memory spaces.
- Harvard Architecture is commonly used in embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, where speed and efficiency are important.

To summarize, Harvard Architecture is a type of computer architecture that separates memory spaces for instructions and data, which can make a computer faster and more efficient.
