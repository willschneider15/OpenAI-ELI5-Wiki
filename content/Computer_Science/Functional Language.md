# Functional Language

Functional languages are programming languages that allow you to write code that is organized into functions. Functions are like little recipes that you can use to perform specific tasks. They take in some data, do something with it, and then return a result.

Functional languages are different from other programming languages because they use a different approach to solving problems. Instead of writing code that tells the computer what to do, you write code that describes what needs to be done. This makes it easier to understand and debug code.

Functional languages also have features that make them easier to use. For example, they can be used to write code that is easier to read, and they can be used to write code that is more efficient.

Functional languages are becoming increasingly popular because they allow developers to write code that is more reliable and easier to maintain. They are also much easier to learn than other programming languages.
