# Speculative Execution

Speculative Execution is a way for computers to work faster by guessing what instructions might be needed next. It works by the computer executing instructions that it *thinks* might be needed, before it knows for sure. This way, if the instructions are actually needed, the computer can finish the task faster because it has already started working on it. If the instructions aren't needed, the computer can simply discard the work it has done. This way, the computer can save time by not having to wait until it knows for sure what instructions are needed.
