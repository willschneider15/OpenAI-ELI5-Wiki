# Class

## Class

A class is like a cookie cutter. 

Just like how a cookie cutter cuts out a specific shape from a dough, a `class` defines a blueprint or a template to create objects with specific properties and behaviors.

* A `class` is a collection of properties (data) and methods (functions) that define a new type of object. 
* The properties define the state or characteristics of that object, while the methods define the behavior or actions of that object. 
* A class acts like a blueprint or a template for creating multiple similar objects. 
* Just like how a cookie cutter can be used to make multiple cookies of the same shape and size, a class can be used to create multiple objects with the same set of properties and behaviors. 
* Each object created from a class is called an instance of that class. 
* You can think of a class as a category of objects with similar characteristics and abilities. 

So, if you want to create an object with specific properties and behaviors, you can define a class and then create instances of that class.
