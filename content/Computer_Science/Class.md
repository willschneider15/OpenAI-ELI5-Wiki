# Class

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It's like a template that describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. Objects are like real-world things that you can interact with, like a car or a person.

Classes have properties, which are like characteristics of the object. For example, a car class might have properties like color, make, and model. It also has methods, which are like actions that the object can do. For example, a car class might have methods like drive, brake, and park.

When you create an object from a class, it's called an instance. An instance of a car class might be a red Honda Civic. It would have the color property set to red, the make property set to Honda, and the model property set to Civic.

Classes are a great way to organize and create objects. They let you create multiple objects with the same properties and methods, but with different values. This makes it easier to create and manage objects in a program.
