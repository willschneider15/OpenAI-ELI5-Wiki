# Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be used over and over again to perform a specific task. Think of them like a recipe for making something - you follow the steps and end up with a delicious result!

* Functions are like recipes - they tell the computer what to do step-by-step
* They can take inputs (like ingredients in a recipe) and produce outputs (like a finished dish)
* Functions can be called (or used) multiple times in a program, making code more efficient and easier to read
* They can also be combined with other functions and code blocks to create more complex programs
* Functions are used in many programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++
* Without functions, programmers would have to write the same code over and over again, which would be time-consuming and error-prone.
