# Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model is a software development approach that follows a linear, sequential path from one step to the next. It is a step-by-step process that starts with the initial planning of the project, followed by the design, implementation, testing, and finally, maintenance. 

At each step, the project is thoroughly reviewed and approved before moving on to the next step. This method is often used when the requirements of the project are well-defined and the scope of the project is clear. It is also used when the development team has a lot of experience with the product and the technology.

The Waterfall Model is a good choice when there is a need for a structured, organized approach to software development. It is also useful for projects that need to be completed quickly, as it allows for a more direct approach to development. However, it is not ideal for projects that require a lot of changes or for projects that are more complex.
