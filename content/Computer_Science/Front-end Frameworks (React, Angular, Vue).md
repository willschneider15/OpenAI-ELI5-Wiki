# Front-end Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

Front-end frameworks are tools used to create interactive webpages and applications. They are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. They provide developers with a pre-built structure that makes coding easier and faster.

React, Angular, and Vue are three of the most popular front-end frameworks. React is great for creating user interfaces quickly, Angular is great for creating single-page applications, and Vue is great for creating lightweight, fast webpages. 

Each framework has its own components and features that can be used to create interactive webpages. For example, React has components like buttons and forms that can be used to create interactive webpages. Angular has directives and services that can be used to create single-page applications. And Vue has components and transitions that can be used to create fast and lightweight webpages.

Overall, front-end frameworks are great tools for creating interactive webpages and applications. They provide developers with a pre-built structure that makes coding easier and faster.
