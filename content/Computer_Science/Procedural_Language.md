# Procedural Language

Procedural Language is a computer programming language that mainly follows a sequence of commands or instructions that the computer should carry out in a particular order. Here are some explanations that could clarify procedural languages for a five-year-old:
- Procedural programming involves following step-by-step instructions to complete a task, much like a recipe for baking a cake.
- Think of a set of directions that need to be followed in a specific order to complete a Lego project. Each step is a procedure or a set of rules to be followed in a particular order. Building a Lego model is procedural.
- Similarly, when writing code to create a program, procedures give structure to the code by breaking the program down into sections or blocks of code that can be reused, modified, and tested on their own.
- Procedural languages prioritize functionality and follow a systematic approach to programming that emphasizes the process of creating well-written, efficient programs by dividing a task into smaller, more manageable procedures.
- Examples of procedural programming languages include C, Pascal, and Basic.

So, in simple terms, a procedural language is a step-by-step method to solve a programming task that follows a systematic approach to programming using a set of instructions, giving structure to the program, and making it easy to reuse, modify, and test.
