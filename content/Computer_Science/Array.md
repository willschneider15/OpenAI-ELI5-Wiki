# Array

An array is a way of storing a list of items. It is like a box with many compartments, each of which holds a single item. All the items in the array have the same type; for example, all numbers or all words. Arrays are useful because they let us store and access data quickly and easily. We can use the index of each item in the array to find it quickly. For example, if we have an array of numbers, we can look up the number at index 4 to find the fourth item in the array. Arrays are used in many programming languages and are a great way of organizing data.
