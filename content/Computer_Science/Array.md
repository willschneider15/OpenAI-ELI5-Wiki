# Array

An array is like a box of chocolates. Instead of chocolate, it holds data like numbers, words, dates and more. The box can have multiple compartments that store different pieces of data. Here are some of the characteristics of an array.

* **Size** - The box can have a fixed size. This means that it has a fixed number of compartments that can hold data.
* **Indexes** - Each compartment has an index or a position. It starts with zero and goes up to the size of the box minus one.
* **Data Types** - The box can hold only one type of data. So all compartments must store data of the same type like integers or strings.
* **Element** - Each piece of data in the box is an element. We can access elements using their index.

So just like how we identify chocolates from their position in the box, with arrays we access data through their index. Now you can understand arrays like a five-year-old!
