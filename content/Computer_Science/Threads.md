# Threads

A thread is like a tiny robot that can do things at the same time as other robots.

* When a computer program runs, it can have lots of tasks to do.
* Sometimes it makes sense for the program to do more than one task at the same time.
* To do this, the program can create different threads, like different robots, to do different tasks simultaneously.
* Each thread can work independently of the others, so they can all work together to make the program run faster.
* It's kind of like having a bunch of friends help you do different parts of a big project so you can finish it faster.
* Threads can share resources like memory and data, but they have to be careful not to work on the same thing at the same time or things can get messy.
