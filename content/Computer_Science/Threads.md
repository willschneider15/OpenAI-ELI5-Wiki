# Threads

Threads are like mini programs that run inside a larger program. They help the program do multiple tasks at the same time. Threads are like little workers that can do parts of the program's job. They can run in parallel, which means they can do things at the same time. This makes the program faster and more efficient. Threads can also communicate with each other, so they can share information and work together. Threads are like a team of workers that can help a program do its job better and faster.
