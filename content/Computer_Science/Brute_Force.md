# Brute Force

Brute Force is the simplest method for solving problems in computer science. It works by trying every possible solution until the correct one is found. Like a monkey that keeps banging on a keyboard until it types the correct word, brute force attacks are iterative and can take a long time to solve a problem. 

It is like searching for a specific toy in a large room. If the room has many compartments and the toy can be in one of them, then the task of finding it will become time-consuming, as you will have to search in each compartment one by one. 

A few examples of problems that can be solved by using Brute Force technique include finding a password, breaking a cipher, and optimizing a solution to a problem. 

While this technique is used in many fields of computer science, it is not always the most efficient solution. However, in some cases, it is necessary when algorithms for more efficient solutions are not yet known.
