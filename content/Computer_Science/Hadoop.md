# Hadoop

**Hadoop** is like a big box where you can store lots and lots of things. 

Hadoop has 2 important parts: 

* **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** - This is like many boxes connected together where we can store a lot of data. It can store any kind of data like videos, music, photos or more.
* **MapReduce** - This is like a group of people who will help you to do your work. They can read and write stuff from the HDFS box.

When we have really big data to handle, it is not easy to store and understand the data. Hadoop helps to solve this problem by breaking the big data into smaller pieces (like splitting the big chocolate bar into smaller pieces) and then storing it in many smaller boxes (HDFS). When we want to do something with the data, MapReduce helps us by breaking the work into small pieces and giving it to different people (like giving one small piece of chocolate to each friend). 

In short, Hadoop helps us to store and manage very big data by dividing it into smaller pieces and making it easier to work with the data.
