# Distributed Systems

Distributed Systems are networks of computers that work together to achieve a common goal. Each computer in the network is connected to the other computers and can communicate with them. The computers can share resources, such as data, programs, and hardware, and they can also work together to solve problems. Because the computers are distributed, they are able to process data faster than a single computer could. Distributed Systems are used in many fields, such as finance, healthcare, and aerospace. They allow for faster and more efficient processing of data, and they can also help to improve security.
