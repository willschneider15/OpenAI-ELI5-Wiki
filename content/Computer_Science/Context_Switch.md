# Context Switch

**Context Switch**

A context switch, in simple terms, means giving a pause to what you are currently doing and start doing something else. In Computer Science, context switching occurs when the processor switches from one task to another.

 * Imagine you are playing a game on your computer. Suddenly, your mom asks you to pause the game and have your dinner.

 * Similarly, computer processors have to switch between different running programs or tasks to execute them.

 * To accomplish a context switch, the processor saves the state of the currently running task in its memory, including the values of the registers, program counters, and stack pointers.

 * In the next step, the processor retrieves the state of the waiting task from its memory and restores the values, allowing it to resume where it left off.

 * The process of context switching takes some time, which can cause delays or time overhead in running programs, especially in multi-tasking operating systems.

 * Context switching is important because it enables the processors to execute multiple programs concurrently and makes the computer more efficient and responsive.

In summary, context switching is like pausing one task and switching to another; it occurs when processors switch between different running programs, which requires saving and restoring the state of each program.
