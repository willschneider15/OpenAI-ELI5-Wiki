# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used to process data that contains sequences. RNNs are special because they can remember information from previous inputs. This allows them to make decisions based on what they have seen before.

To understand how RNNs work, think of them as a loop. It takes in an input, processes it, and then produces an output. The output is then fed back into the network as a new input, allowing it to learn from the previous input. This process repeats until the network has learned enough to produce the desired output.

RNNs are used in many different applications, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction. They are powerful tools that can be used to solve complex problems that require the ability to remember and learn from past data.
