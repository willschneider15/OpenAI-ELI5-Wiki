# Char

A **char** is like a letter or a symbol in a computer program. 

* It's a small piece of information that the program uses to represent text.

* Think of it like playing with building blocks where each block has a letter or symbol on it that you can put together to make words.

* In computer programs, each letter or symbol is assigned a number.

* This number is called the **ASCII code** and it helps the computer store and understand the letter or symbol.

* Chars are useful because they are small and easy to work with in a program.

* Programmers can use chars to create words and sentences in a program or to perform operations on text.

* Overall, chars are an important part of computer programming because they allow programs to work with and manipulate text in various ways.
