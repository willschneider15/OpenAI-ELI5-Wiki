# Android

Android is the name given to a software system that powers a lot of phones and tablets. It was developed by a company called Google, and it's kind of like the "brain" of your device. Here's how it works:

- Android is based on something called "open source" software, which means that people can look at the code that makes it work and make changes to it if they want to.
- When you turn on your Android phone or tablet, the Android software starts up and gives you a screen with a bunch of icons on it. You can tap on these icons to open up different apps, like a phone app, a camera app, or a game app.
- There are lots of different Android phones and tablets out there, made by different companies like Samsung and LG. They all run Android, but sometimes they might look a little different or have different features.
- You can download new apps for your Android device from something called the "Google Play Store." There are millions of different apps to choose from, including games, social media apps, and tools for getting work done.
- Android is always being updated with new features and improvements, so it's a good idea to keep your device up-to-date if you can.
