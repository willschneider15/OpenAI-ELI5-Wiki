# Integration Testing

Integration testing is a type of software testing that checks how different components of a program interact with each other. It is a process of combining different modules of a program and testing them as a group. The goal is to make sure that the different modules work together correctly and that the program functions as expected.

Integration testing is usually done after unit testing and before system testing. During integration testing, the individual modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure that they all work together properly. This is done by running the program and checking the output to make sure that it matches the expected results.

Integration testing is important because it helps to identify any issues that may arise when different components of a program interact. By finding and fixing any problems before the program is released, the quality of the program can be improved and the user experience can be enhanced.
