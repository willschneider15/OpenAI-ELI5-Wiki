# signed vs unsigned

Signed and unsigned are terms used in computer science when dealing with numbers. 

* Signed numbers have a positive or negative sign, while unsigned numbers only have positive values.
* A positive sign in a signed number means the number is greater than zero. A negative sign means the number is less than zero. 
* In short, signed numbers can be both positive and negative integers or floating-point numbers, while unsigned numbers can only be positive integers. 
* For example, a signed integer can store a range of numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, whereas an unsigned integer can only store positive numbers ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295. 
* The main difference between the two is that when performing arithmetic operations, it can lead to different results with unsigned and signed numbers.
* It is important to use the correct type of number (signed or unsigned) when defining variables to avoid errors in program execution.

In summary, signed and unsigned are types of numbers used in computer science. Signed numbers can be positive or negative, while unsigned numbers are only positive.
