# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of writing code to make sure that it works correctly. It starts with writing tests for a piece of code before writing the code itself. Then, the code is written to make sure that it passes the tests. After that, the code is refactored or improved to make sure it works even better. This process is repeated until the code is perfect. TDD helps developers make sure their code is working correctly, and it also helps them find and fix bugs quickly. It also encourages developers to write clean, well-structured code.
