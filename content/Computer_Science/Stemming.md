# Stemming

Stemming is a way of reducing words to their root or base form. It is a process used in natural language processing (NLP) to make it easier to analyze text. The idea is to reduce words to their base form, or stem, so that they can be grouped together more easily. For example, the words "play", "plays", "played", and "playing" all stem from the same root word, "play".

Stemming is an important part of NLP because it allows us to group words together that have the same meaning. This makes it easier to analyze text, as many words can be grouped together instead of having to analyze each individual word. Stemming also helps to reduce the size of the text, making it easier to process.

Stemming is done using a set of rules, which can vary from language to language. These rules tell the computer which parts of a word should be kept and which should be removed. For example, in English the suffix "-ed" is often removed from the end of a verb, leaving just the stem.
