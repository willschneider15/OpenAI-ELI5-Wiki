# Cryptography

Cryptography is like secret codes that people use to keep messages safe and private. 

* When you want to send a message to someone, you can put it into a secret code so that nobody else can read it. 
* Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms (like puzzles) to scramble your message so that only someone with the key can unscramble it and read your message. 
* Cryptography can also be used to make sure nobody messes with your message without you knowing. 
* Cryptography is used all the time around the world to keep information safe, like passwords and credit card information.
