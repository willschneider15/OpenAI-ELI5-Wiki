# Stack

A **Stack** is a simple data structure that works like a stack of books. Here are some key points:

- Imagine you have a pile of books or toys, each one stacked on top of the other. You can't remove just one from the middle of the pile, you have to take the top one off first.
- Similarly, in a stack data structure, the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This is known as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
- When you add a new item to the stack, it goes on top of the existing items.
- When you remove an item from the stack, you can only remove the top item.
- The stack has two important operations you can perform: push and pop.
  - `push` means adding a new item to the stack.
  - `pop` means removing the top item from the stack.
- Think of a stack like a call stack in a programming language. Each time a new method is called, it gets added to the top of the call stack. When it's finished, it gets removed from the top of the stack. This is why if there's an error in the middle of a method, the program "crashes" or stops.
