# Space Complexity

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory that a program requires to run. It is a measure of the total amount of memory used by a program during its execution. 

Space complexity is important because it affects the amount of physical memory needed to run a program. It can also determine the speed of a program, as programs with higher space complexity will require more memory and thus take longer to run.

Space complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of variables or data structures used in a program. For example, if a program uses two variables, then its space complexity is two. If a program uses an array, then its space complexity is the size of the array.

In summary, space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory that a program requires to run. It is important because it affects the amount of physical memory needed to run a program and can determine the speed of a program. It is usually measured in terms of the number of variables or data structures used in a program.
