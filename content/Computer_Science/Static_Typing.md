# Static Typing

Static typing is a way of making computer programs more reliable. It's like having a list of rules that every piece of information in the program has to follow. This way, the program can check that everything is correct before it actually runs. Think of it like knowing the color of the pieces of a puzzle and what shape they are beforehand. 

In static typing, we have data types like numbers, strings, and booleans, and everything is categorized under them. We can't mix them up or use them in the wrong way. This helps identify errors early on as we try to write the program. 

Here are a few benefits of Static Typing:

* **Earlier error detection:** Static typing forces the programmer to declare things upfront, and helps to identify issues before the program is executed. 

* **More reliable software:** With static typing, we can know what data types we're working with in the program. As a result, we're less likely to introduce bugs and the software is more reliable. 

* **Better documentation:** When we write code using a statically typed language, we give the computer more information than what we would do in a dynamically typed language. 

With static typing, we can write programs in a more organized and consistent way, and helps us to produce more reliable software.
