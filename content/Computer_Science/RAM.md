# RAM

**RAM** stands for Random Access Memory. It is a component of a computer that stores all the things the computer is currently working on.

- RAM is like a big room with many drawers.
- Each drawer is like a memory unit, where data can be stored temporarily.
- When you open a program or file, the computer puts a copy of it in one of the drawers.
- The more programs you open, the more drawers you need to store them.
- The bigger the room, the more drawers it can have and the more programs you can run at once.
- RAM helps your computer work quickly and efficiently.
- When your computer runs out of drawers, it has to start swapping things in and out of them, which makes it slower.
- Once you turn off your computer, everything stored in RAM is lost. That's why you need to save your files to a permanent storage like a hard drive.
