# Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is a technology that uses computer algorithms to identify a person's face from a digital image or video. It works by comparing the facial features of a person in the image or video with a database of known faces. The computer can then match the person's face with the correct name or other information stored in the database.

Facial recognition is used in many different ways. It can be used to help identify people in a crowd, to unlock smartphones and other devices, and to make sure that people are who they say they are when using online services. It can also be used for security purposes, such as to prevent unauthorized access to buildings and other areas.

Facial recognition technology is becoming more and more advanced, and it is changing the way people interact with technology. It is becoming increasingly common in many different areas of life, from security to convenience.
