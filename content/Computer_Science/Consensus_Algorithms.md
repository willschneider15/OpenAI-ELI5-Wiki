# Consensus Algorithms

A **consensus algorithm** is like a bunch of friends trying to decide where to eat for dinner. Here's how it works:

* Each friend has to give their opinion on where they want to go.
* Then, everyone has to listen to each other and figure out what place everyone is okay with.
* This way, nobody is left unhappy.

In the same way, a consensus algorithm is used by computers to agree on something. Here are some key points to remember:

* When many computers need to work together to do something (like verify a transaction), they use a consensus algorithm to agree on what to do.
* Each computer has to communicate with the others to figure out what they want to do.
* The computers work together to find the best solution that everyone is okay with.
* This way, all the computers are in agreement, and everything runs smoothly.

Overall, a consensus algorithm helps computers communicate and work together to get things done. It's just like how friends work together to decide where to eat!
