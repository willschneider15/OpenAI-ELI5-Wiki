# Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a computer program that can identify important things in text. Think of it like playing a game of "I Spy" with words! 

* When you use this program, it can look at a bunch of words and find the ones that are people, places, or things. 
* For example, if you gave it a sentence like "Sarah went to the store to buy groceries," the program would be able to figure out that "Sarah" is a person and "the store" is a place. 
* NER is useful because it can help save time when analyzing large amounts of text - humans can sometimes miss important pieces of information, but NER can quickly catch things that stand out. 
* It can also be used to help with things like searching for specific topics or to help answer questions about a piece of writing. 

Overall, Named Entity Recognition is a helpful tool for finding important words in text and making analyzing large amounts of information easier for us humans!
