# Internet of Things (IoT)

Internet of Things (IoT) is when we give objects like toys, cars, buildings, and even our own bodies the ability to talk to each other and take control without human interaction. 

* IoT enables us to make our daily activities easier, and our surroundings more efficient and useful. 
* It connects devices to the internet so they can communicate without human assistance.
* By collecting data and sharing it with other devices, IoT can help us save energy, reduce waste, and automate many routine tasks.
* IoT technology allows us to create smart homes, offices, and cities.
* It helps us to monitor our own health, and offers opportunities to improve medical treatments.
* With IoT, we can develop sensors that detect changes like temperature, moisture, and movement, making them applicable in contexts ranging from agriculture to industrial manufacturing.

IoT is one of the fastest growing areas in technology, and its impact on our daily lives is becoming increasingly visible.
