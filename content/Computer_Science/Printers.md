# Explaining Printers to a 5-Year-Old

Printers are like a special kind of machine that can take things you make on a computer or phone and turn them into something you can hold in your hands. It does this by using ink or special paper that it heats up to make the words and pictures appear. You can use a printer to make things like school projects, pictures, cards, and even books! It's really cool how a printer can take the things you make on a computer and turn them into something you can actually touch.
