# Printers

A printer is like a robot who writes on paper. 
- It takes your computer's words and pictures and turns them into paper copies. 
- You can choose to print anything like homework assignments, pictures, or letters. 
- There are different types of printers, some can only print black and white while others can print in color. 
- The most common type of printer is an inkjet, which sprays tiny dots of ink onto paper. 
- Another type of printer is a laser printer, which uses a special kind of ink called toner and melts it onto paper. 
- Printers need ink or toner to work, and you have to check them regularly and replace them when they run out. 
- Some printers can also scan documents and make photocopies of them. 
- Finally, if you want to make sure the paper comes out neatly, you might have to adjust the printer settings like the print quality or paper size.
