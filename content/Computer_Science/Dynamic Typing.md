# Dynamic Typing

Dynamic typing is a programming language feature that allows a variable to hold a value of any data type. It is different from static typing, where a variable is declared to hold only a specific data type.

In dynamic typing, when a variable is assigned a value, the type of the value is not checked until the code is run. This means that a variable can have different types of values assigned to it at different points in the program. This flexibility can be useful when writing code, as it allows for more efficient use of memory and makes it easier to write code that is flexible and adaptable.

Dynamic typing also makes it easier to write code that is less prone to errors, as the type of the value assigned to a variable is only checked when the code is run. This means that any errors that may occur due to incorrect data types being used will be caught before the program is executed.
