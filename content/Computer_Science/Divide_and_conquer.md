# Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer is a strategy that allows us to solve big problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Here's an explanation of this concept that even a 5-year-old can understand:

* Imagine you have a big pile of Legos and you need to build a castle. But you don't know where to start.
* Divide and conquer means you start by sorting the Legos into smaller piles by color or shape. This way, you can see what you have and plan how to use them.
* Once you have your smaller piles, you can start building smaller parts of the castle, like the walls, towers, and drawbridge. Since each part is smaller, it's easier to focus on building it and making it perfect.
* Once all the smaller parts are built, you can put them together to create the big castle!
* The same approach will work for any problem that seems too complex to solve all at once. Just break it down into smaller parts and solve them one at a time until the bigger problem is solved.

In computer science:

* Divide and conquer is an algorithmic paradigm based on multi-branched recursion.
* We break down a problem into two or more sub-problems until the sub-problems are simple enough to be solved directly.
* After solving each sub-problem, we combine a solution to the original problem.
* Common examples of divide and conquer algorithms are Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search etc.
