# Waterfall Model

The Waterfall Model is like baking a cake: 

* **Requirements**: First, you figure out what ingredients you need and what type of cake you want to make. This is like collecting requirements for the project.
* **Design**: Next, you make a plan for how you will bake the cake. This is like creating a design for the project.
* **Implementation**: Then, you follow the plan and actually bake the cake. This is like implementing the project plan.
* **Testing**: After baking, you check to make sure the cake tastes good and looks good. This is like testing the project to make sure it works correctly and meets the initial requirements.
* **Deployment**: Finally, you serve the cake to your guests. This is like deploying the project to users.

In other words, the Waterfall Model is a linear project management process that follows a sequential flow; when one stage of the process is complete, the team moves on to the next one. Here are some key takeaways:

* Each stage of the process depends on the completion of the previous stage.
* The Waterfall Model is a popular and well-established method of project management.
* It's a straightforward process that allows for clear documentation and tracking of project progress.
