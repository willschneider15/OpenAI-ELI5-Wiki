# Registers

Registers are special memory locations inside a computer that store data. They are much faster than regular RAM memory and are used to store data that is needed quickly. Data stored in a register can be accessed and changed in a single clock cycle, which is much faster than the time it takes to access data stored in RAM. Registers are used to store data that is currently being used in a program, such as the values of variables and the address of the next instruction to be executed. They can also be used to store intermediate results of calculations, allowing the computer to quickly access and use the data. Registers are an important part of a computer's architecture and are essential for the efficient execution of programs.
