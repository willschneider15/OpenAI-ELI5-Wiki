# Data Compression

Data compression is when you reduce the size of a file or piece of data so that it takes up less space on your computer. This is like putting your clothes in a smaller suitcase when you go on vacation so that they take up less space in your luggage. 

Here are some things to know about data compression: 

- When you compress data, you use a special program that takes out parts of the file that aren't needed, like extra spaces or repeating patterns, and makes the file smaller. 
- This is useful because smaller files take less time to send over the internet or save on your computer. 
- There are two types of compression: lossless and lossy. Lossless compression keeps all the information in the file, but makes it take up less space. Lossy compression removes some information from the file, so it doesn't look exactly the same as the original, but takes up even less space. 
- Examples of compressed files include mp3 music files, jpg image files, and zip or rar archive files. 
- Data compression is used in many industries, including video game development, movie making, and data storage.
