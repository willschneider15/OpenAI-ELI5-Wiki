# Sentiment Analysis

**Sentiment analysis** is when you teach a computer how to understand if someone is happy, sad or angry when they write something online.


Here are some details: 
- People write things online like on Twitter or Facebook.
- Sometimes people use words that mean they are happy or sad or angry.
- Sentiment analysis looks at what people write and picks out words that mean they are happy, sad or angry.
- Then sentiment analysis tells us if people are mostly happy or mostly sad or mostly angry.
- This can be really helpful to companies who want to know what people think about them.
- Sentiment analysis can also help people who are researching things like public opinion or social trends.
- But sometimes, sentiment analysis can make mistakes because sometimes people write things that don't actually mean what they say, like sarcasm.
- So, sentiment analysis isn't perfect, but it can help us learn a lot about how people feel.
