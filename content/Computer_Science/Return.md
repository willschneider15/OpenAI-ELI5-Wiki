# Return

**Return** is like giving something back.

- In programming, when a function is called, it does some work and may produce a result at the end.
- The `return` statement is used to send this result back to the place where the function was called.
- It's like telling the function "Okay, you did your work. Now give me the result."
- Once the result is `returned`, it can be used by other parts of the program.
- If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it means it doesn't produce any result - like a chef who cooks, but doesn't give you the food.
- We can also return multiple values using a `tuple` - imagine a box that has many things inside, and we can take them out separately.
- When a `return` statement is executed, it ends the function and control goes back to the calling code.
