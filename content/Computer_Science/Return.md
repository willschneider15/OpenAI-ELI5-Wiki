# Return

Return is a concept in computer programming that allows a program to send back a response. It is used in functions and subroutines.

Return is like a game of catch. When you throw a ball, the person you throw it to catches it and throws it back. In computer programming, the return statement is like catching the ball. It takes a value from the function and sends it back to the program.

When a return statement is used, the program stops running the function and returns the value. This value can be a number, a string, or an object. It all depends on what the programmer wants the function to do.

Return is an important concept in computer programming because it allows the programmer to get data from a function and use it in other parts of the program. Without return, the programmer would have to write a lot more code to get the same result.
