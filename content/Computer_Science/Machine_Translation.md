# Machine Translation

Machine translation is when computers help people to understand things written in a different language. It works like a robot that takes in words and sentences in one language, and then gives you back those same words and sentences in another language that you can understand.

Here's how machine translation works:

* Computers use special software to analyze the words and grammar of a sentence.
* It compares those words and grammar to a database of words and grammar from another language.
* Then, the computer uses its "best guess" to translate the sentence into the other language.

Machine translation is not always perfect, but it is getting better all the time. Some examples of machine translation tools include Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate.

People use machine translation for lots of different reasons, like:

* To help them understand a message from someone who speaks a different language
* To translate websites, documents, or emails from one language to another
* To communicate with people from different parts of the world who speak different languages.
