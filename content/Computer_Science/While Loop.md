# While Loop

A while loop is a type of loop in computer programming. It is used when you want to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. 

To use a while loop, you first need to set a condition. This condition is usually a comparison between two values, such as if a number is less than 10. Then you write the instructions you want to repeat until the condition is met. 

When the program runs, it checks the condition. If it is true, then the instructions are executed. If the condition is false, then the loop stops and the program continues with the next set of instructions. 

The while loop can be used to repeat instructions a certain number of times, such as printing out the numbers from 1 to 10. It can also be used to repeat instructions until a certain value is reached, such as finding the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10. 

In summary, a while loop is a type of loop used to repeat instructions until a certain condition is met. It can be used to repeat instructions a certain number of times or until a certain value is reached.
