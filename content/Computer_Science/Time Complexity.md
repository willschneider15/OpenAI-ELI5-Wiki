# Time Complexity

Time complexity is a measure of how efficient a program is. It tells us how much time it takes for a program to complete an operation. 

A program can be broken down into small parts called algorithms. Each algorithm has a certain amount of time it takes to complete. If a program has a lot of algorithms, it will take longer to complete. 

Time complexity measures how long a program will take to finish based on the number of algorithms it contains. The more algorithms a program has, the longer it will take to finish. 

Time complexity is measured in Big O notation. Big O notation tells us how quickly a program will run in relation to the number of algorithms it contains. For example, if a program has 10 algorithms, it will take longer to finish than if it had 5 algorithms. 

Time complexity helps us understand how efficient a program is and how long it will take to finish. We can use this information to make sure our programs are running as efficiently as possible.
