# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is like playing with Legos!

1. First, we think of a small Lego model that we want to create.
2. Next, we plan what pieces we will need and how they will fit together.
3. We then start building the model one piece at a time.
4. After we complete each piece, we test to make sure it works before moving on to the next one.
5. If something doesn't work, we take it apart and try again until it does.
6. We keep building, testing, and fixing until our Lego model is complete and works perfectly.

In software development, TDD follows the same basic process:

1. First, we think of a small piece of code that we want to create.
2. Next, we plan what inputs we will need and what the code should output.
3. Then, we write a test that fails if the code doesn't do what we planned.
4. We run the test to make sure it fails.
5. Next, we write the code until the test passes.
6. We keep writing tests and code until the code works perfectly and passes all tests.
