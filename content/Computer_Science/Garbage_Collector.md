# Garbage Collector

Garbage Collector is a system that helps clean up the unnecessary things in your computer so it can run better. Imagine your room is your computer, and your toys are your computer programs. 

* Sometimes you play with your toys, and sometimes you forget about them and leave them on the floor, taking up space in your room.
* Garbage Collector is like your mom who comes in and cleans up the toys you are no longer using, and puts them away so that you have more space to play with your favorite toys.
* In computer terms, your programs create objects that take up space in your computer's memory. Garbage Collector regularly checks the memory for objects that are no longer being used by any of your programs, and destroys them so their memory can be used by other programs.
* This helps keep your computer running smoothly and prevents it from slowing down or crashing due to lack of free memory.
* In Java, C#, and other programming languages that use Garbage Collector, you don't have to manually delete objects from memory, making it easier for programmers to write code without worrying about memory management.
