# Imperative

**The concept of Imperative**

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of commands that change a program's state. In simpler words, imperative programming is a style of programming that involves giving commands to or controlling the actions of a computer. It is primarily oriented towards describing how one goes about solving a problem (procedure or algorithm) using sequential commands that correspond to a mathematical model.

Here are some characteristics of Imperative programming:

- It is based on the Von-Neumann architecture.
- It uses a sequence of commands, which are executed one after the other, to perform a certain task.
- Imperative programs typically heavily rely on variables or mutable state.
- It makes use of loops and conditional statements to control execution flow.
- Imperative code is stateful, meaning that the values of variables can be changed during program execution, leading to changes in the resulting output.

Imperative programming can be contrasted with declarative programming, in which a program describes the desired result without specifying the prescribed actions that achieve it. However, both programming paradigms have their own unique use cases and benefits.
