# Imperative

Imperative programming is like giving a set of instructions to a computer. It is a type of programming language that tells the computer what to do and how to do it. It is like giving the computer a list of tasks to complete. 

The computer follows the instructions in the order they are given and performs the tasks one at a time. It can also make decisions based on the information it receives. To do this, the computer uses a set of statements that tell it what to do. 

The statements can be simple, like "add two numbers together", or more complex, like "find the shortest path between two points". The computer follows each step until it reaches the end. 

Imperative programming is a great way to get the computer to do what you want it to do. It is also very fast and efficient, making it a popular choice for many applications.
