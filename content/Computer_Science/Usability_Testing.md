# Usability Testing

Usability testing is like trying out a new toy before you buy it. 

* It's a bunch of people who test a website, app or software. 
* They do different things to make sure it works well and is easy to use. 
* They might try clicking on buttons, reading instructions, or doing tasks like shopping online. 
* The people who make the website or app watch what they do and listen to their feedback. 
* They use what they learn to make changes that will make the website or app better for everyone to use. 

Just like how your mom or dad might ask you to try out a puzzle before they buy it for you, the people who make websites and apps want to make sure that it is easy and fun for you to use too!
