# Encryption Algorithms

Encryption algorithms are like secret codes that make it difficult for bad people to see our messages. 

* To understand, think of two friends passing notes in class.
* If they don't want the teacher to read the note, they'll create a secret way of writing it.
* Encryption algorithms are like secret ways of writing texts.
* They use a set of rules to scramble the message and only those who know the rules can decode it.
* Some encryption algorithms use math problems to create the secret code.
* Others use a password, like a secret word only you and your friend know.
* Encryption algorithms can protect important information, like passwords or credit card numbers, that we don't want others to see.
* They are used to keep things safe on the internet and on our computers. 

Remember, just like in the classroom, it's important to keep secrets safe!
