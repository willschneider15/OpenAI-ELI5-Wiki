# Functional Language

Functional languages are programming languages that work with functions. These languages focus on using functions to create programs rather than objects or procedures. Here is a quick overview of functional languages:

* **Functions:** A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. Functional languages treat functions as a basic building block for creating programs.

* **Immutability:** In functional programming, values are immutable, which means they cannot be changed. This makes it easier to reason about code and reduces the risk of bugs.

* **No Side Effects:** Functional languages emphasize avoiding side effects, which are changes made to external state by a function. This helps in creating a predictable code.

* **Recursion:** Recursion is a technique used in functional programming to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

* **Higher Order Functions:** Higher order functions are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return functions as output. This is useful for creating more complex functions.

* **Concurrency:** Functional languages support concurrency, which is the ability of a program to run multiple tasks at the same time.

Overall, functional languages are powerful tools for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces using functions.
