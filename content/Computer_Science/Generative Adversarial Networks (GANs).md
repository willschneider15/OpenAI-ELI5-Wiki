# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of artificial intelligence that uses two neural networks to generate new data. One network, called the generator, creates new data, while the other network, called the discriminator, evaluates the data to determine if it is real or fake. The generator and discriminator work together to improve the accuracy of the generated data. The generator creates data that is so realistic that the discriminator is unable to distinguish it from real data. This process is repeated until the generated data is indistinguishable from real data. GANs are used in a variety of applications, such as image generation, text generation, and data augmentation.
