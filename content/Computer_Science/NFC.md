# NFC

NFC stands for Near Field Communication. It is a type of wireless communication that allows two devices to communicate with each other when they are close together. It works by using electromagnetic radio fields to transfer data between two devices.

NFC can be used for many things, such as transferring data from one device to another, making payments, and even unlocking doors. To use NFC, two devices need to be close together, usually within a few centimeters. When the two devices are close enough, they will be able to exchange data.

NFC is a great technology for many applications, such as mobile payments, access control, and data transfer. NFC is becoming more and more popular, and it is becoming easier to use. With NFC, you can do things like make payments, unlock doors, and transfer data quickly and securely.
