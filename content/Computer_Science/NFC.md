# NFC

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a way for two devices to talk to each other by getting really close. Imagine two friends standing really, really close to each other to whisper a secret message. That's kind of like how NFC works! 

Here are some more things to know about NFC:

* First, you need a device that has NFC. This could be your phone, your headphones, or even your credit card.
* To use NFC, you just need to hold your device close to another device with NFC.
* Once the devices are close enough (usually about 4cm or less), they can start talking to each other.
* NFC can be used for lots of things, like paying for things with your phone or transferring files between two devices.
* Overall, NFC is a really easy and convenient way to share things between devices or even make payments without having to carry a wallet or cash. 

So, even though NFC might sound complicated, it's actually really simple!
