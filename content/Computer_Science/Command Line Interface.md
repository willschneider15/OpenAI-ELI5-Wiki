# Command Line Interface

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way of interacting with a computer without using a graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, commands are typed into a text-based window to tell the computer what to do. 

For example, a user can type "cd" to change the current directory, "ls" to list the files in the current directory, or "mkdir" to create a new directory. A CLI is often used by experienced computer users to quickly perform tasks without having to use a mouse or other graphical tools.

CLIs are often used to automate tasks, such as running scripts or programs. This allows users to quickly and easily perform complex tasks without having to manually type in commands.

Overall, a CLI is a powerful tool for experienced computer users that allows them to quickly and easily perform tasks without having to use a graphical user interface.
