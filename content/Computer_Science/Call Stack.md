# Call Stack

A call stack is like a stack of pancakes. It's a collection of instructions that a computer follows in order to complete a task. Think of it like a stack of pancakes that you would make for breakfast. Each pancake is a step that you need to complete in order to make the pancakes. 

When you create a program, the computer takes the instructions you wrote and puts them in a call stack. The first instruction is put on the bottom of the stack, like the first pancake. Then, each additional instruction is put on top of the previous one, like a stack of pancakes. 

When the computer is ready to execute the instructions, it starts with the top of the stack. It executes the instruction, then takes it off the stack. Then, it moves to the next instruction and repeats the process. This continues until the call stack is empty, and the task is complete. 

The call stack is an important concept in computer science because it helps the computer understand how to execute the instructions you wrote. Without it, your program wouldn't work!
