# Image Processing

Image Processing is when computers use special algorithms and programs to analyze and manipulate images. It's like playing with digital clay!

- Images are made up of tiny dots called pixels.
- Image Processing allows us to change things about these pixels, like their brightness, contrast, or color.
- We can also use Image Processing to zoom in on a specific part of an image, or to crop out unwanted areas.
- Image Processing can be used for things like enhancing images for medical diagnosis, improving the quality of photos and videos, or even detecting hidden details in photographs.
- It's like using a digital magic wand to make pictures look better or uncover hidden information. 

In short, Image Processing helps us to improve and manipulate pictures using special tools and programs, kind of like a digital art project!
