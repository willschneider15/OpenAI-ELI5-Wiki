# Heap Memory

Heap memory is like a toy box. Just like you have a toy box where you keep all your toys, the computer has a place where it keeps all its toys or data.

- The computer uses memory to hold information while it is being used.
- The memory is like a toy box where the computer stores its programs, files, and data so that it can access them quickly.
- Heap memory is a place in the computer's memory where it can put data if it doesn't know how much space it will need ahead of time.
- Imagine having a toy box with three compartments, but you don't know how many toys you will get. You can put them in any compartment you want because you don't know how much space you need.
- Heap memory is like having an infinite number of compartments. When the computer needs to store something, it can put it in any compartment it wants because it doesn't know how much space it will need.
- This makes heap memory really useful for things like storing data structures that can grow or shrink as the program runs.
