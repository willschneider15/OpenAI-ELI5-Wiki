# RTOS

**Real-time Operating System (RTOS)** is a type of operating system designed for devices that have strict timing requirements. Imagine you are playing a game and you press a button. You expect to see an immediate response. An RTOS ensures that the response time is quick enough so that there is no delay between your action and the response on the device.

Here are some important features of an RTOS:

- Predictable response: An RTOS guarantees the response time to different events. This is important for critical applications such as medical devices or airplanes.
- Multitasking: An RTOS allows multiple tasks to run at the same time so that the device can handle different requests simultaneously.
- Real-time scheduling: The tasks are scheduled based on their priorities and deadlines to meet their timing requirements.
- Efficient resource management: An RTOS ensures that the device's resources such as memory, CPU, and I/O are used efficiently so that the performance is optimal.
- Kernel: The kernel is the core component of an RTOS that manages the system resources and provides services to the applications running on it.

In summary, an RTOS is a specialized operating system that ensures quick and predictable responses in real-time applications.
