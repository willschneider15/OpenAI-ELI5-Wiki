# int

**`int`** is a special kind of number that computers use to represent whole numbers. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- **What is a number?** A number is a way of counting things. It's like a label we attach to a group of things so we can keep track of how many there are. For example, if you have 2 apples, you could say there are "two" apples.

- **What is a whole number?** A whole number is a number that doesn't have a fractional part. For example, "2" is a whole number, while "2.5" is not.

- **What is an `int`?** An `int` is a way of storing whole numbers in a computer. It's short for "integer". Computers use `int`s because they're very efficient and allow for fast calculations.

- **What can you do with an `int`?** You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide `int`s just like any other numbers. You can also use `int`s to represent things like the number of items in a shopping cart, the score in a video game, or the number of times a loop should run.

In short, an `int` is a special way of representing whole numbers in a computer that allows for fast and efficient calculations.
