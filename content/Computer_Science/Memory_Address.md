# Memory Address

**Memory Address**

A memory address is like the street address of a house for a computer to find information. Here's a simple explanation that even a five year old could understand:

- Computers have a short term memory called RAM (Random Access Memory) where they store temporary information while they work on a task. 
- Each piece of information in RAM has a unique address that the computer uses to find it again. Think of it like houses on a street; each house has a unique number that helps people find it.
- A memory address is made up of a bunch of numbers that tell the computer exactly where a piece of information is stored in RAM.
- When a program wants to access a piece of information in RAM, it tells the computer the memory address of that piece of information. It's like saying "I want to go to 123 Main Street."
- The computer then goes to the memory address and retrieves the information stored there.

In conclusion, a memory address is a unique set of numbers that a computer uses to find information it needs in its short term memory (RAM).
