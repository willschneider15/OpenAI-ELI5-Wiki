# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is like a waiter who brings you food from the kitchen in a restaurant.

* When you want to see a website, your computer sends a message to the website's server to bring the website to your computer.
* This message is like ordering food from the kitchen.
* The server sends the website to your computer in small pieces (like courses in a meal) using HTTP.
* Each piece is like a dish on a plate.
* Your computer puts all the pieces together to create the whole website, just like you eat all the dishes to have a full meal.
* If your computer needs more pieces to complete the website, it sends another message to the server to bring more pieces (like ordering a dessert).
* HTTP is like the waiter who brings the food, but instead of food, it brings parts of the website to your computer.
