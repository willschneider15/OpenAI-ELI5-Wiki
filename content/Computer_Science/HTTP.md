# HTTP

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a way for computers to communicate with each other over the internet. When you visit a website, your computer sends an HTTP request to a server, which is a computer that stores information. The server then sends back an HTTP response, which contains the information you requested. This response is usually a web page, but it could also be an image, video, or other type of file. HTTP is like a language that computers use to understand each other, allowing us to access websites and other online resources.
