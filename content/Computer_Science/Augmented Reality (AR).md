# Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that adds virtual elements to the real world. It uses digital images and sounds to enhance the user's experience.

AR works by combining the physical world with the digital world. It uses cameras and sensors to detect the environment around you. Then, it adds virtual objects or content to the environment.

For example, if you are playing a game, the game might add virtual objects to the real world. You might see monsters or characters that you can interact with.

AR can also be used for educational purposes. For example, a school might use AR to teach about different animals or plants. The students would be able to see the animals or plants in their environment and interact with them.

Overall, AR is a great way to make the physical world more interactive and exciting. It can be used for entertainment, education, and more!
