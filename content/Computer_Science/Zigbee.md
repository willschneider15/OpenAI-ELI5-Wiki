# Zigbee

[Zigbee](https://www.digi.com/lp/what-is-zigbee-technology) is a type of technology that helps electronic devices talk with each other wirelessly. It can be used to make smart homes or manage the data of industries. Here are some key points to understand Zigbee:

- Zigbee's signal can travel long distances without a lot of power, so it's great for devices that need to be far apart.
- Zigbee uses a special network called a mesh network, which makes sure all devices can connect to each other easily. Think of it like a spider web where each spider can feel a vibration from another spider on the web.
- It is a cheaper and more efficient way of making devices connect to the internet. 
- It is designed to be secure from hackers who may wish to steal or alter the data being shared by the devices using it.
- It allows multiple controllers to communicate with each other and distribute the workload.
