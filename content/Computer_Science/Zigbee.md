# Zigbee

Zigbee is a type of wireless communication technology used to connect devices together. It is a low-power, low-cost, and low-data-rate networking protocol designed to provide reliable, secure, and fast communication between devices. Zigbee networks are used in a wide variety of applications, such as home automation, industrial automation, and medical monitoring.

In a Zigbee network, devices communicate with each other using short-range radio signals. Each device acts as a node in the network and can send and receive data. The nodes are organized into a mesh network, which means that if one node is unable to reach another node directly, it can relay the data through other nodes in the network. This allows for a robust and reliable communication system.

Zigbee is an open-standards protocol, meaning that anyone can develop products that use it. This has allowed for a wide range of products to be created that are compatible with each other. It is also energy-efficient, making it ideal for applications that require low-power communication.
