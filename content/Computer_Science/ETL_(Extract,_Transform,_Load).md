# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is the process of moving data from one place to another. Here's a simple explanation:

- **Extract** means to get the data from a source system. Imagine you have a bag of candy. If you want to share the candy with your friends, you need to take it out of the bag first. Extracting data is similar. You have to take the data out of the source system so you can use it somewhere else, like a different database or reporting tool.
- **Transform** means to change the data in some way. Let's say your bag of candy has different types of sweets in it: gummies, chocolates, and lollipops. Your friend only likes gummies. To transform the candy, you would take out the chocolates and lollipops, so your friend only gets the gummies. In the same way, you might transform data by removing certain fields or changing the format.
- **Load** means to put the transformed data into a new system. After you've sorted the candy, you put the gummies into a small bag and give them to your friend. Loading data is similar. You put the transformed data into a new database, data warehouse, or reporting tool for future use.

Overall, ETL is a way to move and manipulate data so that it can be used in a different system.
