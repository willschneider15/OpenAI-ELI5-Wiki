# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning that helps machines learn to make decisions and take actions in an environment. It is similar to how a child learns - by trial and error. The machine is given a goal and it tries different actions to reach the goal. It receives rewards or punishments for each action and learns from the experience.

The machine uses a reward system to learn which actions lead to the goal and which ones do not. It is like a game - the machine gets points for doing the right thing and loses points for doing the wrong thing. Over time, the machine learns which actions lead to the best rewards and it gets better and better at making the right decisions.
