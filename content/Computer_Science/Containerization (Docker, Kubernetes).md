# Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

Containerization is a way of packaging software into self-contained units that can be used to run applications quickly and reliably on any environment. It helps to isolate applications from each other, so that they can each run in their own environment without any conflicts. Docker and Kubernetes are two popular tools used for containerization. Docker is a tool that allows developers to package their applications into containers, which are then run on any environment. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps to manage a cluster of containers and provides tools for deploying and managing applications. Together, these tools make it easier for developers to quickly and reliably deploy applications in any environment.
