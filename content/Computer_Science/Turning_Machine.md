# Turning Machine

A Turing machine is like a robot that knows how to read and write on a long paper tape. Here's how it works:

* Imagine drawing a bunch of rectangles on a piece of paper that represent states and arrows between them that represent transitions.
* The Turing machine starts at a specific state.
* Depending on what it reads on the paper tape, it either stays in the current state or transitions to a new state.
* At each state, it can also write a new symbol onto the tape.
* The machine keeps going from state to state, following the arrows, until it reaches an accepting or rejecting state.
* If it reaches an accepting state, it has successfully solved a problem!

Turing machines might seem simple, but they're actually really powerful. In fact, any algorithm that can be computed by a computer can also be computed by a Turing machine. We use Turing machines to understand what problems are computable and what problems are not computable.
