# Operating Systems

Operating systems are the "boss" of your computer. They make sure everything runs smoothly and that different programs don't bother each other. Here are some things they do to make this happen:

- Manage your computer's resources, like the processor (brain), memory (work area), and storage (filing cabinets).
- Communicate between different parts of the computer (like the keyboard, screen, and printer) and programs (like email and games).
- Protect your computer from bad programs or viruses that could damage it.
- Allow multiple people to use the same computer at the same time. This is why you can log in to your own account on a shared computer, and everything looks different when your friend logs in.
- Provide a way for you to talk to your computer, either through a graphical user interface (like clicking and dragging with your mouse), or by entering text commands with a keyboard.
