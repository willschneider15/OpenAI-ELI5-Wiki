# Symmetric-key Cryptography

Symmetric-key cryptography is a technique used to keep information secure by using a secret code shared between two people. Here's how it works:

* Imagine you and your friend are passing notes back and forth. You want to keep your messages secret from anyone else who might see them.

* You and your friend agree on a secret code, like replacing every letter with the one that comes after it in the alphabet (so A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on).

* Whenever you want to send a message, you use the secret code to encrypt it. Only your friend, who knows the secret code, can read the message.

* When your friend wants to reply, they use the same code to encrypt their message. Again, only you can read it because you know the secret code.

This is how symmetric-key cryptography works. In this scenario, the secret code is the "symmetric key" and both you and your friend use the same key. In real life, computers use complex algorithms to create symmetric keys that are almost impossible for anyone else to guess.
