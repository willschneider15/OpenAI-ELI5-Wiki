# Embedded Systems

Embedded Systems are small computer systems that are designed and built to perform very specific tasks. An embedded system is like a tiny computer that is built into a larger device or machine. 

Here are some key points to help understand Embedded Systems:

- Embedded Systems are often found in everyday objects like cars, cameras, and even toys.

- They are designed to perform a specific function or set of functions.

- Embedded Systems are often low-power and have limited processing and memory capabilities.

- They typically run on specialized operating systems or firmware.

- They are programmed to interact with other devices or systems to complete their tasks.

- Unlike desktop computers, Embedded Systems are usually hidden from the user and operate in the background.

- They can be networked together to create larger systems that can perform more complex tasks.

In summary, Embedded Systems are small, specialized computers that are designed to operate within larger devices. They perform a specific set of functions and are programmed to interact with other devices or systems to complete their tasks.
