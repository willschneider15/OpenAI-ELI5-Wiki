# System Testing

System testing is a type of software testing that checks if the system as a whole is working properly. It is done after all the individual components of the system have been tested. System testing tests the system's functionality and performance, as well as its compatibility with other systems. 

System testing is done by simulating real-world scenarios, such as multiple users using the system simultaneously, to check how the system behaves under different conditions. It also tests the system's security and reliability, making sure that it can handle unexpected errors and still work properly. 

System testing is an important part of the software development process. It ensures that the system is stable and reliable before it is released to the public. Without system testing, the system may have bugs or other issues that could cause it to malfunction.
