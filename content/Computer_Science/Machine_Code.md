# Machine Code

Machine code refers to instructions that computer hardware understands and can execute. It is sometimes called machine language or assembly language. Here's what you need to know about it:

- Machine code is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) that is specific to a particular processor. 
- These binary digits are grouped into instructions that tell the computer what to do at a very low level. 
- Each instruction has a specific purpose, such as moving data between two locations in memory or performing a mathematical operation. 
- Because machine code is specific to a particular processor, it can be difficult to program directly in machine code. 
- Programmers often use higher-level languages like Python or Java to write their code, which is then compiled into machine code by a translator program called a compiler. 
- Despite its low-level nature, machine code is the foundation of all computer software, from basic operating systems to complex applications.
