# CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a computer language used to make websites look pretty! Using CSS, a person can change the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout of a webpage. It's like decorating a cake - you can add frosting, sprinkles, and decorations to make it look unique and pretty. 

Here are some things you can do with CSS:

* Change the color of the text and background
* Change the font type and size
* Adjust the spacing between elements
* Position elements where you want them on the page
* Add animations and special effects

CSS can be used on all sorts of websites - from simple blogs to large, complex applications. Without CSS, websites would look boring and be harder to use. So next time you visit a website, take a closer look at the colors and how everything is laid out - it's all thanks to CSS!
