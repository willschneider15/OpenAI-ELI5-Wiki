# Bit

A **bit** is a tiny piece of information that computers use to work with information. 

* A computer is basically a machine that works with information.
* Each bit is like a tiny switch that can be on or off.
* When the switch is on, we call it a 1. When it's off, we call it a 0.
* Everything a computer does is based on having the right pattern of 1s and 0s. 

For example, imagine we're working with a number. 

* If we have a bit that's on, it means that we add a certain amount to the final number. 
* If it's off, then we don't add anything. 
* Computers use many bits to work with large amounts of information, like a billion numbers all at once!
