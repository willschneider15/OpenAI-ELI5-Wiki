# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a process that helps developers to quickly and easily incorporate changes into their code. It works by having developers commit their code changes to a shared repository, such as GitHub. From there, the CI system will automatically build and test the code, alerting the developers if any errors occur. This helps developers to quickly identify and fix any problems with their code before it is released to the public. CI also helps to ensure that the code is always up-to-date and free of any bugs, making it easier to release new features and updates. In short, continuous integration helps developers to quickly and easily incorporate changes into their code, ensuring that the code is always up-to-date and free of any bugs.
