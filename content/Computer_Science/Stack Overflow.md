# Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a website for computer programmers. It is a place where people can ask questions about programming and get answers from other programmers. It works like a stack of books. When you ask a question, it is put on the top of the stack. Other programmers can then answer the question and their answers are put on the stack, below the original question. The answers can be voted on, and the best answer will be at the top of the stack. So, when you need help with programming, you can go to Stack Overflow and ask a question. The best answer will be at the top of the stack, just like the book on the top of a stack of books.
