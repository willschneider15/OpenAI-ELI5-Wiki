# For Loop

For Loops are a type of programming statement that can be used to repeat a set of instructions. They are often used to repeat a task multiple times, such as counting from one to ten. 

To create a for loop, you first need to give it a start value, a stop value, and an increment value. The start value is the number that the loop will start at, the stop value is the number that the loop will end at, and the increment value is the amount the loop will count by each time. 

Once these values are set, the loop will begin. It will start at the start value and count up to the stop value, adding the increment value each time. Once it reaches the stop value, the loop will end. 

For example, if you set the start value to 1, the stop value to 10, and the increment value to 1, the loop will count from 1 to 10. This means that the loop will run 10 times, counting up from 1 to 10 each time. 

For loops are a great way to automate repetitive tasks, such as counting or printing out a list of numbers. They can also be used to loop through a list of
