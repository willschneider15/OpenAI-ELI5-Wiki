# Race Condition

A race condition happens when two or more things are trying to access the same information at the same time, and the outcome is unpredictable. Just like when you race to be the first one to get to the toy box, sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. In computers, this can cause errors, crashes or other unexpected behavior.

Here's an example:

1. Imagine two friends working on the same Google doc from different computers.
2. Friend 1 is working on paragraph 1 of the document, while friend 2 is editing the document's title.
3. When friend 1 tries to save their work, the program starts to sync the changes with the server.
4. But at the exact same time, friend 2 also saves their changes to the document title.
5. Now the program is confused because it's not sure which change it should save first - the title or the paragraph 1.
6. This can cause the document to look jumbled and senseless!

In summary, a race condition happens when two processes compete to access shared data, and the outcome may be unpredictable. It's important to be aware of this concept in programming to avoid unexpected results in your applications.
