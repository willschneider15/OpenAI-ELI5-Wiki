# Phishing

Phishing is like a bad guy pretending to be your friend to steal your snacks. Just like your mom tells you not to talk to strangers, you should also be careful of strange emails and links on the internet.

Here's how it works:
* The bad guy sends you an email or a message that looks like it's from a friend or a company you know, like your bank or Amazon. 
* The email asks you to click on a link or enter your personal information like your password, credit card or social security number. 
* If you click on the link or give away your personal information, the bad guy can use it to steal your money or identity. 

Remember:
* Look carefully at who the email is from. If it's from someone you don't know or it looks weird, don't click anything. 
* Always check the URL of the link before you click on it. Make sure it's the real website you want to go to. 
* If you think the email might be real, but you're not sure, ask a parent or teacher before you click on anything. 

Stay safe on the internet and don't give away your snacks (or personal information) to strangers!
