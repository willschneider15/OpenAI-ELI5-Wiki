# Boolean

Boolean is a term used in computer science which means one of two things can be true. Here's an example: When we ask a computer to answer "yes" or "no" to a question, we're asking it to perform a Boolean operation. This type of question can only have one of two answers, so it's considered Boolean-compatible. 

* A Boolean is a simple data type that holds a single value: either true or false. 
* This type of data can be used in many different ways in programming, helping decisions to be made programmatically.
* Boolean operations are frequently used to evaluate conditions in programming, and are key to modern programming languages.
* They can be combined using logical operators, such as "AND", "OR", and "NOT".
* Boolean mathematics forms the basis of modern computing and computer languages, and underpins all of the smart devices we use every day, from computers to smartphones to smart home systems.
