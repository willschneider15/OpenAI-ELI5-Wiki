# IP Address

An IP address is like a street address for your computer. It's a unique number that can be used to identify your computer on the internet. Just like a street address, it is made up of four numbers separated by periods. Each number can range from 0 to 255. 

An IP address helps computers find each other on the internet. When you type a website address into your browser, your computer uses the IP address to find the website you want to visit. 

An IP address can also be used to help keep your computer safe. When you visit a website, your computer sends your IP address to the website. The website can then use your IP address to block you from accessing the website if it wants to. 

In summary, an IP address is like a street address for your computer. It helps computers find each other on the internet and can be used to help keep your computer safe.
