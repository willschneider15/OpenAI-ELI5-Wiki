# DDoS Attacks

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are malicious attempts to make a computer or network unavailable to its users. They occur when an attacker overwhelms a computer or network with too much traffic, causing it to crash and be unable to serve its intended purpose. DDoS attacks can be launched from many different computers at once, making them difficult to defend against. The attacker usually gains access to these computers by infecting them with malicious software, which then allows them to control the computers remotely. Once the attacker has control of the computers, they can send large amounts of traffic to the target computer or network, causing it to become overloaded and unable to respond to legitimate requests. As a result, the computer or network can become unavailable to its users.
