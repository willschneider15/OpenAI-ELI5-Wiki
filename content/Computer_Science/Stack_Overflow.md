# Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a website where people can ask questions about computer programming.

* It's like a library for people who want to learn how to program or need help with programming problems
* Instead of books, it has questions and answers about programming
* Sometimes people post questions that are very similar to ones that have already been answered 
* This can make it harder to find the answer you need
* When a question is asked and answered on Stack Overflow, it's saved so that anyone who has the same question can find the answer quickly
* When a lot of people ask the same question, it creates a "stack" of questions and answers, like a stack of pancakes
* If too many people ask the same question, it can cause the website to break and stop working properly
* This is called a "Stack Overflow" because the website's "stack" of questions and answers overflows and can't hold any more
