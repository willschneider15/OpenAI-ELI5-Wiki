# Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT stands for Internet of Things. It is a network of physical objects that are connected to the internet. These objects can be anything from phones, computers, and even everyday items like refrigerators and toasters. These objects can collect data, send data, and even act on that data. 

For example, a refrigerator can collect data about the temperature inside and send that data to the internet. Then, it can act on that data by turning on a fan to cool down the refrigerator. 

IoT is also used in many other industries such as healthcare, transportation, and energy. It can help make things run more efficiently and save time and money. For example, a hospital can use IoT devices to monitor a patient's vital signs and alert the medical staff if there is a problem. 

Overall, IoT is a powerful technology that can help make our lives easier and more efficient.
