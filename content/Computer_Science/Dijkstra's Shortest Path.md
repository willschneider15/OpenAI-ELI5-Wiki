# Dijkstra's Shortest Path

Dijkstra's Shortest Path is an algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph. It works by starting at one point and exploring all of the possible paths until it finds the one with the lowest cost. The algorithm keeps track of the cost of each path and chooses the one with the lowest cost. As it goes along, it updates the cost of each path so it can find the shortest path. The algorithm is useful for finding the shortest route between two points on a map or a network.
