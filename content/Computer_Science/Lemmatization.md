# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is like having a magic dictionary that helps us turn words into their simpler, more basic forms. It's a tool that computers use to make sense of the words we write and understand what they mean.

Here's an example of how it works: 

- Let's say we have the word "running". 
- Through lemmatization, we can convert it into its basic form "run". 
- This is helpful because it allows us to make connections between different forms of the same word in a document or text. 

Lemmatization can be used for different purposes: 

- Spellchecking 
- Text processing 
- Information retrieval 

It's important to note that lemmatization is different from stemming, which also tries to get to the root form of a word, but the resulting root may not always be a valid word. 

By using lemmatization, we can help computers better understand the text we create, making it easier for them to gather insights and information.
