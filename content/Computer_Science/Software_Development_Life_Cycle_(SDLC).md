# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

# SDLC

SDLC or Software Development Life Cycle refers to the process of developing software applications from the initial planning phase to the final product delivery. It consists of several distinct phases, each with its own specific objectives and goals.

## Phases of SDLC

- **Planning**: Determine the requirements and objectives of the project. Identify the scope of the project and define the features and functions that are required.

- **Designing**: Create a detailed design of the software based on the requirements and objectives that are defined in the planning phase. Define the architecture of the system and finalize the technology stack.

- **Building**: Develop the actual software using the specifications defined in the design phase. Ensure proper coding and error handling mechanisms.

- **Testing**: Test the software against the design and requirements specifications to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free from errors or bugs.

- **Deployment**: The software is released and deployed to the production environment where it can be used by users.

- **Maintenance**: The software is maintained by fixing bugs, updating features and functions, and any other necessary modifications.

## Conclusion

The SDLC process ensures that software is built to meet the requirements, is scalable, and is of high quality. It involves rigorous testing to ensure that the software is error-free and meets customer needs.
