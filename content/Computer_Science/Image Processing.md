# Image Processing

Image processing is a way of manipulating digital images. It is used to enhance or change the appearance of the image. It can be used to make an image look brighter, sharper, or more colorful. It can also be used to remove unwanted elements from an image, such as noise or blur. Image processing can also be used to detect objects in an image, such as faces or text. By analyzing the pixels in an image, algorithms can be used to identify and extract features from an image. Image processing can be used for a variety of applications, such as medical imaging, surveillance, and facial recognition.
