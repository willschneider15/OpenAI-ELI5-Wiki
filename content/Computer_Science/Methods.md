# Methods

Methods are like recipes in cooking. 
* A recipe is a set of instructions on how to prepare a meal, while a method is a set of instructions on how to perform a task in programming.
* Methods are used to break down complex tasks into smaller manageable parts.
* They enable programmers to reuse code and make their programs more efficient.
* A method is typically made up of a method signature and a method body.
* A method signature is made up of the method name, return type, and parameters.
* The method body is where the instructions are written for what the method should do.
* When a program calls a method, it executes the instructions within the method body, then returns a value if it has a return type.
* Methods are created by defining them within a class or interface. 
* Once a method is defined, it can be called from any other part of the program.
