# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of computer system that can learn and make decisions based on data. They are inspired by the biological neural networks found in the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that process information. Each neuron is connected to other neurons and can pass signals to them. When a neuron receives a signal, it processes the information and passes it on to the next neuron. This process continues until the data is processed and a decision is made. ANNs can be used to solve complex problems, such as recognizing faces or understanding language. They are used in many areas, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and robotics. ANNs are powerful tools that can help us understand and solve complex problems.
