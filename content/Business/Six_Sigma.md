# Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a method that businesses use to make improvements in their processes. Here's how it works:

* **Step 1:** Identify what needs to be improved. This could be anything from how long it takes to make a product to how much money is being spent on a particular process.

* **Step 2:** Measure the current performance of the process. This means figuring out how long it takes to make a product or how much money is being spent on a particular process.

* **Step 3:** Analyze the data. This means looking at the numbers to figure out why the process is not performing as well as it should be.

* **Step 4:** Improve the process. This is where changes are made to the process to improve its performance.

* **Step 5:** Control the process. This means putting in place a way to monitor the process to make sure it continues to perform as well as it should.

Six Sigma is designed to help businesses reduce errors and defects in their processes so that they can increase efficiency and save money. By following the five steps of Six Sigma, businesses can identify and fix problems quickly and effectively.
