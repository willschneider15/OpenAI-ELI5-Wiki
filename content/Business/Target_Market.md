# Target Market

- A target market is a group of people who are most likely to buy a product or service.
- This group is defined by their similar needs or characteristics.
- An example of a target market for a toy store would be families with young children.
- When businesses identify their target market, they can create and market products that cater specifically to the needs of that group.
- This ensures that their marketing efforts are more effective.

A business can:

- Conduct market research to identify their target market.
- Analyze their customer base and determine the common characteristics and needs of their most loyal customers.
- Segment their target market based on demographics (e.g. age, gender, income), psychographics (e.g. personality, values, interests), and behavior (e.g. purchasing habits, brand loyalty).
- Create marketing messages and strategies that appeal specifically to their target market.
- Continuously review and adjust their target market strategy to stay relevant and competitive.
