# Competition

Competition is like a race where people or businesses try to do better than others.  Here are some important things to understand:

* Competition happens when two or more people or businesses have the same goal or are trying to sell the same thing.
* In order to "win" the race, people or businesses try to do things better or faster than their competitors.
* This can lead to better quality products or services, lower prices, or improved customer service.
* When there is more competition, consumers can benefit because they have more options to choose from and prices are driven down.
* However, too much competition can also be harmful because businesses may be forced to cut corners or lower quality in order to keep costs low.
* Good competition is important because it helps businesses adapt and improve over time.
* In the end, whoever does the best in the race wins and becomes more successful.
