# Organizational Structure

Organizational Structure is the way a company is organized. It shows how different levels of people relate to each other and how power and authority flow in the company. Imagine a tree with many branches. Each level has a different position or role to play, and each person knows who they report to and who they manage.

* The structure of a company defines its hierarchy
* It shows who is responsible for what
* Each person has a specific role to play
* It determines the communication flow in the company
* It impacts work processes and decision-making
* A good organizational structure improves efficiency, communication, and accountability 
* Different types of organizational structures include hierarchical, flat, matrix, and networked. 

In short, organizational structure is like a blueprint that helps individuals and teams understand where they fit in the larger picture of the organization.
