# Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy refers to a process that happens when you can't pay your bills. It's like being at a store with no money and not having anyone to help you. 

* Bankruptcy means you're unable to meet the financial obligations you owe to others.
* It happens when you owe more money than you have or can make.
* When you file for bankruptcy, it means you ask the government for help so you can sort out your financial mess.
* You may have to sell things you own to pay back some of what you owe.
* Bankruptcy can have a harmful effect on your credit score, which is like your money grade, making it difficult to get loans or buy things on credit in the future.

It's important to stay on top of your bills and be responsible with your money to avoid bankruptcy. If you find yourself in a difficult financial situation, it's essential to get help from professionals to find the best possible solution.
