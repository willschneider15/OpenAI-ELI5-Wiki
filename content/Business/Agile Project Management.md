# Agile Project Management

Agile Project Management is a process used by businesses to manage projects in a flexible and fast way. It is like playing with building blocks that can be moved and changed easily. 

* Imagine a project is like building a tower with building blocks.
* Agile Project Management allows the project manager to take apart certain blocks of the tower and rearrange them easily and quickly.
* It enables teams to be more flexible and adaptable to changes as they occur.
* The process involves breaking a project into smaller, more manageable tasks called sprints.
* Each sprint is like a mini-project that lasts around 2 weeks with a specific goal in mind.
* After each sprint, the team reevaluates how the project is going and makes adjustments as necessary.
* Agile Project Management encourages collaboration and communication between team members.
* It helps to ensure the end product meets the needs of the customer and is delivered on time and within budget. 

Overall, Agile Project Management is a way to manage projects that allows teams to be more flexible, adaptable, and collaborative.
