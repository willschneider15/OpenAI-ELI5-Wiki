# Pensions

A **pension** is like a bank account that is built up over time by someone who is working. When someone works, they put in a portion of their salary into their pension account. This is called a contribution. 

- The person's employer may also put some money into the account as part of their benefits package. 
- The money in the pension account is then invested, which means it is used to buy stocks, bonds, property, and other things that may grow in value over time.
- When a person reaches a certain age, usually when they retire, they can start to withdraw the money in their pension account as regular payments.
- The amount they can withdraw depends on how much they and their employer contributed and how well the investments did over time.
- The purpose of a pension is to provide a financial cushion for someone when they are no longer earning money from work. 

Having a pension plan is important because it helps people save for their future needs and offers a secure source of retirement income.
