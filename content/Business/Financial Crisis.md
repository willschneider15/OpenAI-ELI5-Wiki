# Financial Crisis

A financial crisis is like when something bad happens to your allowance. Here are some things to help you understand it better:

* Imagine you get a weekly allowance from your parents. This is like the money that banks and businesses get to use for their own purposes.
* Now imagine that there's not enough money to go around. This could happen if your parents don't have enough money to give you your allowance.
* When this happens to banks and businesses, they might not be able to pay their bills or debts. Just like how you might not be able to buy the things you want with your allowance if you don't have enough money.
* This can cause a lot of problems for everyone involved. Companies might have to lay off workers, and people might not be able to afford the things they need.
* Governments can try to help by giving money to struggling businesses, but this can also cause problems in the long run.

Overall, a financial crisis happens when there isn't enough money to go around and it can cause a lot of problems for everyone involved.
