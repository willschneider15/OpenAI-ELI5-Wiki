# Materials Requirement Planning (MRP)

Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) is a way of organizing the things a company needs to make its products. Here are the main things you should know:

* MRP helps a company figure out how much of each material it needs.
* It looks at a company's upcoming orders and plans out what materials are needed, and when.
* MRP makes sure that the company has enough materials to meet customer orders.
* It can also help prevent a company from ordering too much of something and wasting money.
* The goal of MRP is to keep a company's production running smoothly by making sure that the right materials are available at the right time.
    
In summary, MRP is a planning tool that helps businesses to make sure they have enough materials to make their products. It helps to avoid overstocking, understocking, and delays in production.
