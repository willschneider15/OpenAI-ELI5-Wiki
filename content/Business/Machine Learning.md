# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a smart computer system that learns just like you do. It is like a child who learns from their parents or teachers. Machine learning learns from its work or experiences and improves itself over time. 

* Machine learning is like a robot's brain that can see or hear things from the world and then makes decisions based on that input
* It learns from data and improves when it is fed with more data
* Machine learning can find hidden patterns in data that even humans can't see
* It is used in many areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing
* Many everyday gadgets, like personal assistants and self-driving cars, use machine learning to work properly
* It is a very important area of technology that is growing very rapidly over time
