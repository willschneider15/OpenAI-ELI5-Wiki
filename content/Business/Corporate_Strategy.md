# Corporate Strategy

Corporate strategy is like a big plan for a really big company! It helps the company decide what kind of business they want to be and how they can be successful. It's like a map that tells the company how to get to where they want to go. Here are some things you might find in a corporate strategy:

* The company's mission, or what they want to achieve
* Goals, or what the company wants to accomplish in the short term and long term
* How to use the company's resources to reach those goals
* What kind of products or services the company wants to offer
* Who the company wants to sell those products or services to
* How to compete with other companies to make sure the company does well
* What kind of culture or values the company wants to have

Corporate strategy is like a plan for a big game. Just like how a sports team needs a plan to win a game, a company needs a strategy to succeed in business.
