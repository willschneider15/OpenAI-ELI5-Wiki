# Financial Reporting

Financial Reporting is like telling a story about how a business is doing. 

* It's like when you tell your parents what you did with your allowance money.
* The story is told through financial statements that show how much money came in and how much was spent.
* It shows how much money the business has left or how much debt it has.
* The financial statements include things like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements.
* Investors, lenders, and other interested parties use these statements to make important decisions about the business.
* Good financial reporting helps a business make better decisions and communicate its financial health to others. 
* Transparency is important so that investors, shareholders and other stakeholders have a better understanding of the financial position of the company. 
* An accurate portrayal of the financial story also helps build business credibility, which can increase customer and investor confidence.
