# Descriptive Analytics

Descriptive Analytics is like a magnifying glass for numbers. It lets us see the information we have collected and learn more about it. 

* Descriptive Analytics sorts through the data we have and helps us understand it better. 
* It helps us draw out important conclusions and identify patterns or trends in our data.
* For example, think of it like counting how many red and blue cars you see on the road. You might notice that you see more blue cars than red ones. 
* This is helpful information because you can use it to make decisions. For example, if you're a car manufacturer, you might decide to make more blue cars because they seem to be more popular. 
* Descriptive Analytics uses graphs, charts, and tables to help us visualize the data and makes it easier to understand. 
* Overall, descriptive analytics is helpful because it allows us to make informed decisions based on data that we've collected.
