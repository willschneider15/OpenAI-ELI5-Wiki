# Product Life Cycle

The Product Life Cycle refers to the stages that a product goes through from its introduction to the market until it is no longer being produced or sold. There are four stages in the cycle:

* Introduction – This is the stage when a product is first introduced to the market. At this stage, sales are typically low, and the focus is on creating awareness of the product among potential customers.
* Growth – During the growth stage, sales start to increase more rapidly as customers become more familiar with the product. The focus of this stage is on building brand loyalty and expanding the product’s reach.
* Maturity – In the maturity stage, sales growth starts to slow down as the market becomes saturated with the product. Companies may start to alter pricing or marketing strategies to maintain sales.
* Decline – During this stage, sales start to decline as the product becomes outdated or replaced by newer products.

Understanding the product life cycle is important for businesses to adjust their marketing and production strategies to maximize profits and ensure their product stays relevant to customers.
