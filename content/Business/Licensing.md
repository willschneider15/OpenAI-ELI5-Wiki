# Licensing

Licensing is a fancy way of saying "sharing" or "renting" something you made or own to somebody else who wants to use it.

* It's like lending your favorite toy to your best friend for the day.
* Companies and creators can license things like their brand, patents, and software.
* This lets other people use their stuff, but not completely own it.
* In exchange, the person or company who owns the license gets paid for letting others use their product.
* It's a way for businesses to make money off their creations without giving them away for free or selling them outright.

So, licensing is a deal where the owner of something agrees to let somebody else use it in exchange for payment. It's a way for businesses to make money off their creations while still keeping control over them.
