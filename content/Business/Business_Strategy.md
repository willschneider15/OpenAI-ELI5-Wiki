# Business Strategy

Business strategy is like making a plan to win a game.

* A business makes a plan to win in the marketplace.
* A business needs to make decisions about what they will sell and who they will sell it to.
* A business needs to understand what its competitors are doing and how it can beat them.
* A business should think about how it can make the most profit while keeping costs low.
* A business should also think about how it can grow and expand in the future.
* Just like with a game, a business needs to have a strategy to win and be successful.
