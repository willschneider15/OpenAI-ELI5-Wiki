# Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

ESG is a way for businesses to make sure they're doing good things for the world and the people in it. Here's what that means:

- **Environmental:** This is all about the planet. It's important to make sure that the things we use and the way we do things isn't hurting the earth. Some things businesses can do to be environmentally friendly are using less energy, using recycled materials, and not polluting the air or water.

- **Social:** This is about the people who work at and with the business, as well as the people in the community. Some things businesses can do to be socially responsible are treating their employees well and paying them fairly, being inclusive to people of all backgrounds, and supporting the community in which they operate.

- **Governance:** This is about how a business runs itself. It's important to make sure that things are done in a fair and transparent way. Some things businesses can do to have good governance practices are having diverse and experienced leadership, being open and honest with stakeholders, and having policies to prevent corruption.

Overall, ESG is a way to make sure that businesses are doing good things for the planet, people, and society as a whole while also being well-run and ethical.
