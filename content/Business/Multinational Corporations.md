# Multinational Corporations

A Multinational Corporation (MNC) is a company that operates in many countries at the same time. Here’s a simple explanation for the concept like I'm 5:

Imagine you have a lemonade stand. You sell lemonade to your family and friends, and everyone around your neighbourhood. One day, you want to sell your lemonade in another neighbourhood, but it’s too far away for you to walk. So, you ask a friend to sell your lemonade over there.

Now, imagine that you’re running a big company that makes cars. You sell cars to people in one country, and then you want to sell them to people in another country. You can’t just walk there, so you set up a factory in that country to make and sell your cars.

That’s what a multinational corporation does. They set up factories or offices in different countries to sell their products to people who live there. They make things in one country and sell them in another. Here are some important points to remember:

- A Multinational Corporation operates in many countries
- They sell products or services
- They set up factories or offices in multiple countries
- The goal is to sell products to people who live there

Multinational corporations are important for the world economy because it means that people in different countries can buy products that they wouldn’t have access to otherwise.
