# International Trade

International Trade means buying and selling goods and services between different countries. It's like a big market where countries trade things with each other. Here's what you need to know:

* Countries have different resources, skills, and technology 
* Some countries may produce goods more efficiently (and less expensively) than others
* Countries can sell their goods to other countries who can't produce them as efficiently 
* This is what we call international trade 
* Countries can specialize in producing what they are really good at and trade with other countries for things they may not be as good at producing 
* This is called comparative advantage 
* International trade can lead to increased competition, lower prices for consumers, and increased economic growth for countries who participate in it 

Overall, international trade is important for countries to meet their needs and also allows for a diverse global marketplace.
