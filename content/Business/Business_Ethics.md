- Business ethics is when a company wants to do the right thing.
- It means that a company shouldn't do anything that might hurt other people or the environment.
- Business ethics includes treating employees well, making sure customers are happy, and not cheating anyone.
- It's like being a good friend and not lying or taking something that doesn't belong to you.
