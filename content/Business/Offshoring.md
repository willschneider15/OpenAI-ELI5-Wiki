# Offshoring

### Offshoring

Offshoring is like asking someone else to do your homework or chores for you, but instead of asking your friend, you're asking people who live in another country to do it for you. 

* It's when a company moves some or all of its business activities to another country where labor or production costs are cheaper, such as China, India, or Mexico. 
* Offshoring can include customer support, manufacturing, development, accounting, and other business activities. 
* It's a way for the company to save money by paying lower wages or using more cost-effective production methods. 
* However, it can often result in job losses for workers in the home country where the company originally operated. 
* It's important to note that offshoring is different from outsourcing, which involves hiring and contracting another company to do specific tasks instead of moving the entire operation to another country. 

In conclusion, offshoring is a business strategy where companies move some or all of their business activities to other countries to reduce cost, but it can have negative effects on workers in the country where the company originated.
