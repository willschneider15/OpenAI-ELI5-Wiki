# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*KPIs are like your grades in Business. They help you understand how well you are doing and what you need to improve.*

Here are some important things you should know about KPIs: 
- KPIs are measurable values that show how well a business is achieving its goals.
- Just like grades, KPIs provide feedback on what is working well and what needs improvement.
- Different industries and businesses may have different KPIs. For example, a restaurant may track KPIs like the number of customers served, while a software company might track KPIs like revenue growth.
- KPIs should be specific, measurable, and relevant to the business's goals.
- Businesses use KPIs to make informed decisions, identify strengths and weaknesses, and track progress over time.
- Just like how you can improve your grades with hard work, businesses can improve their KPIs by making changes to their strategies or operations.
