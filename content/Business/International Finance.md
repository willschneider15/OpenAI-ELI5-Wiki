# International Finance

International finance is like moving money between different countries. When people or businesses from one country buy or sell things with another country, they need to exchange money. When the amount of money they exchange changes, it affects the value of the currency, which is the money used in that country. This is called exchange rate. Here are some important things to know about international finance:

- Exchange rates can change lots of times in one day, depending on how many people are buying and selling.

- When a country's currency becomes worth more, it's called "appreciation." When it becomes worth less, it's called "depreciation".

- Big changes in exchange rates can really affect a business that buys or sells things in different countries.

- International finance is important so that countries can trade with each other and have better relationships.

- International finance affects everyone, even if they don't know it!
