# Distribution Channels

A distribution channel is the path that a product takes from the manufacturer to the final customer. It is the way in which goods and services move from the producers/sellers to the consumers/buyers. Selling a product directly to a consumer means that the manufacturer has one channel of distribution. In some cases, it is more complicated and involves different intermediaries.

* Products can pass through various intermediaries before reaching the final consumer. These intermediaries act as a bridge between the manufacturer and the consumer.
* Various distribution channels include wholesalers, retailers, agents, and brokers. 
* Wholesalers buy goods from manufacturers in bulk, store them, and sell them to retailers at a profit. 
* Retailers sell goods to consumers through a physical or online store. 
* Brokers are independent contractors who bring together buyers and sellers by acting as intermediaries. 
* Agents are used by manufacturers to promote and sell their products.

A well-planned distribution channel is crucial for effective product delivery and customer satisfaction. It helps the manufacturer focus on production and allows the intermediaries to handle the distribution of goods.
