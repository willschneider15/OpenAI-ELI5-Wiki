# Core Competencies

##### Core competencies: An Easy Explanation

**Core competencies** are what an organization does best. It means that they are the unique selling point that differentiates the business from its competitors. In other words, the specific strengths that a company possesses and can use to create a competitive advantage. 

Think of it this way:

- A basketball player is good at shooting hoops.
- A singer is good at singing songs.
- And a company is good at doing some particular tasks.

Core competencies can be used to build products or services that customers like, to create effective marketing campaigns, to motivate employees, and to build a company culture that is recognizable and successful.

Examples of core competencies include:

- Design and innovation skills in Apple Inc.
- Exceptional customer service skills in Ritz-Carlton Hotels.
- Superior logistics skills in Walmart.

A company's core competencies can evolve with the changing times and trends, so it's crucial to keep them up-to-date and relevant to the market. Companies need to focus on their core competencies and use them to create customer value, which leads to long-term success.
