# Innovation: An Explanation for Children

Innovation means creating something that is new or different from what already exists. Just like a chef might come up with a new recipe, someone who is innovative comes up with new and creative ideas for products, services, or ways of doing things.

### Two Types of Innovation

There are two main types of innovation:

* Incremental Innovation
    * This is when a small change is made to something that already exists. For example, adding a new flavor of ice cream to a brand's line-up.
* Radical Innovation
    * This is when something completely new is created. For example, the first smartphone was a radical innovation because it changed the way we communicate and do things like take pictures, surf the internet, and stay organized.

### Why is Innovation Important?

Innovation is important because it:

* Can make things better for people
* Brings new and exciting products, technologies, and services into the world
* Helps businesses stay competitive and grow
* Can solve problems and make our lives easier or more enjoyable.

Innovation is all around us and it's exciting to think about what new and interesting things we might see in the future!
