# Inclusion and Equity

In simple terms, inclusion and equity refer to treating everyone fairly and making sure everyone feels like they are part of the group.

* **Inclusion** means making sure everyone is included in all activities, regardless of their race, gender, abilities, or background. This means that everyone feels like they belong and are important.

* **Equity** means making sure everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This means that everyone is given what they need to be successful, and no one is left behind.

Together, inclusion and equity are important because:

* They help create a sense of community and belonging among all members
* They encourage diversity and provide opportunities for people with different backgrounds and experiences to share their perspectives and learn from one another
* They ensure that everyone has a chance to succeed, regardless of their individual circumstances.
