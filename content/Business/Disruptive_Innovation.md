# Disruptive Innovation

Disruptive innovation is a fancy term used by business people to describe when a new product or service comes into the market and slowly replaces the old way of doing things. 

Think of it like this:

- You and your friends used to play with toy cars, but now you prefer video games. 
- Or, your parents used to listen to music on CDs, but now they use streaming services like Spotify. 

In both examples, a new product came in and replaced the old one. This is disruptive innovation. 

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- Disruptive innovation can come from smaller companies, not just big ones.
- It often starts by serving a niche market, rather than the mass market.
- Disruptive innovation can be a threat to established companies who don't see it coming.
- Successful companies can stay ahead of the game by being innovative themselves, and by constantly monitoring industry trends. 

Remember, we all like trying new things, and that's what makes disruptive innovation exciting!
