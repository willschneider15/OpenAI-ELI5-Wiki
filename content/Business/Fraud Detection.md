# Fraud Detection

Fraud Detection is like a superhero that identifies when someone is being deceitful with money. Just like how Batman has his Bat-Signal, fraud detection has certain "signals" that it looks out for!
 
* These signals can be things like unusual transactions or patterns that indicate someone might be doing something sneaky with money.
* Fraud detection uses special tools and technology to keep track of all the money moving around.
* When it sees a red flag, it sounds an alarm and investigates to see if there is any funny business going on.
 
So basically: Fraud detection is a superhero that uses special technology to watch over money, and if it sees anything strange or out of place happening, it will investigate to make sure everything is okay.
