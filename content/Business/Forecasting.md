# Forecasting

Forecasting is like predicting the weather in advance. Just like a weatherman tells us what the weather will be like in the future, forecasting helps us make predictions about future events in business. 

* It is a technique that helps businesses to estimate what might happen in the future based on current and historical data.  

* We can forecast things like sales, profits, and cash flow. 

* Forecasting helps businesses to plan for the future by making decisions on how to allocate resources, set budgets and plan production schedules.

* By making predictions about the future, businesses can be proactive instead of reactive.  

* Forecasting is important for businesses to plan for the future and to achieve their goals.  

* It helps businesses avoid problems by identifying potential issues before they happen.  

* Finally, businesses can use forecasting to monitor and evaluate their performance over time.
