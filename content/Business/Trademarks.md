# Trademarks

Trademarks are like special stickers that tell us who made or owns something. 

* Imagine if all your toys looked the same and had no way to tell them apart. 
* Trademarks help us know if something is made by a specific company, like if your toy was made by LEGO or Hasbro. 
* They also help protect companies from other people using their name or logo without permission.
* When a company registers a trademark, it means they have exclusive rights to use it and no one else can use it unless they give permission.
* This helps prevent confusion and allows companies to build their brand by creating a unique identity that people can recognize and trust.
* So, trademarks are like a unique stamp that tell everyone that this product belongs to a specific company and no one else can copy it.
