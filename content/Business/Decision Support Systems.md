# Decision Support Systems

A Decision Support System (DSS) is like a superhero that helps people make better decisions. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* A DSS uses technology to help people gather, organize, and analyze information
* Think of it like a personal assistant that helps you make sense of all the data you collect
* It can help you make predictions about the future based on past trends and data
* A DSS can also help you create "what-if" scenarios to see different outcomes based on different decisions
* The most important thing about a DSS is that it helps people make decisions that are based on data and analysis, rather than just guessing or going with a gut feeling

In summary, a DSS is like having a trusted advisor who helps you make smart choices based on facts and figures.
