# Business Incubators

A **Business Incubator** is a place where a new business can grow and thrive with help. It's like planting a seed in a garden, but instead of just water and sunlight, you get resources, advice, and support. Here's how it works:

* A new business enters the Business Incubator program
* The program gives the business a physical space, like an office or workspace, to use
* The program also provides resources, like equipment or networking opportunities, to help the business grow
* Experts and mentors are available to provide guidance and support
* The goal is to help the business become self-sufficient and successful

Think of it like a school for new businesses! The Incubator provides a supportive environment where new ideas can grow and succeed. By providing resources, advice and support, business incubators help entrepreneurs to have the foundation they need to grow their business.
