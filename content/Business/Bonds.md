## Bonds Explained for a 5-year-old

A bond is like a special kind of IOU. 

* An IOU is something you write when you borrow money from someone. 
* A bond works the same way, but it's a special kind of IOU. 
* When a big company or the government needs to borrow a lot of money, they might issue bonds. 
* People can buy these bonds, which means they are loaning the company or government money. 
* The company or government promises to pay the loan back with interest over time. 
* The interest is like a little extra thank you for loaning the money. 
* Just like a person buying a toy with their pocket money, people can buy bonds with their savings or retirement account. 
* Sometimes, when the bond is all paid back, the person who loaned the money will get back more than they put in! 

That's what a bond is, a special kind of IOU that can help big companies and the government borrow money, and help people grow their savings.
