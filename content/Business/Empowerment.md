# Empowerment

Empowerment means giving power to people, so they feel confident and capable to make their own decisions and take actions without relying on someone else. Here is an explanation of empowerment for a 5-year-old.

* Empowerment means you can do things all by yourself
* It's like when you learn to ride a bike without training wheels. You feel proud and confident that you can ride it on your own.
* When someone is empowered, they have the power to make choices and decisions for themselves
* It makes them feel capable and strong
* Empowerment can come from within ourselves, or others can give us the power to make our own choices

For a Business student, empowerment means giving employees the freedom and authority to make decisions and take actions to achieve a common goal.

* Empowerment improves employee engagement and job satisfaction
* It increases productivity and creativity in the workplace
* Empowered employees are more likely to take responsibility for their work and achieve better results
* Empowerment can be achieved through training, communication, and trust
* Managers must be willing to give up some control and trust their employees to make decisions
* Empowerment is essential in today's rapidly changing business environment, where quick thinking and decision-making are critical to success.
