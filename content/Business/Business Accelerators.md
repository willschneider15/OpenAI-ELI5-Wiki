# Business Accelerators

A Business Accelerator is a program designed to help a new company grow very quickly. Here's what you need to know:

* Imagine you have a small plant, and you want it to grow into a big, strong one. You water it, give it sun, and it grows slowly over time. That’s what it’s like to start a business on your own.
* A Business Accelerator is like using special plant fertilizer that helps your plant grow much faster. This is because they give your business extra support and resources in a short amount of time.
* Business Accelerators provide mentorship, which means they give advice on how to grow your business successfully. They connect you with experts in your field who can give you tips and tricks about what to do (and what not to do).
* They help you make connections with other businesses and investors, which can help you get more funding and make your product or service reach a lot more people.
* Through Business Accelerators you also receive financial support in the form of seed funding or investment in exchange for equity in the company. 
* The goal of a Business Accelerator is to help a startup grow their business in a short amount of time, then let it continue growing on its own.
