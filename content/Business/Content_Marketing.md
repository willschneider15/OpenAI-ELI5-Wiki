# Content Marketing

Content marketing is when a company makes stuff that’s helpful or interesting, so people want to pay attention to what the company is doing. It’s like giving someone a present instead of just asking them to buy something. Here are some important things to know about content marketing:

- It’s all about building a relationship between a company and its customers.
- The “stuff” a company makes can be videos, blog posts, podcasts, or anything that’s interesting or useful.
- The goal is to make people feel good about the company before they even buy anything.
- Content marketing takes time and effort—you can’t just throw stuff together and hope it works.
- The best content marketing feels authentic and real. It should come from a place of wanting to help, not just wanting to sell stuff.
- When done well, content marketing can be more effective than traditional advertising because people actually want to pay attention to it!
