# Promotion and Advertising

**Promotion**

Promotion refers to the various methods used by businesses to inform, persuade, and remind customers about their products or services. Think of it as a way to tell people about a new toy, candy, or game that you want them to come and play with you, so they get excited and come over to play. Similarly, promotion is a way to communicate with customers and get them excited about a new product or service, so they are more likely to buy it.

There are four main types of promotion:
* Advertising: telling customers about your product through paid media channels, such as TV, radio, or billboards.
* Sales Promotion: using short-term incentives like coupons or discounts to encourage customers to buy your product.
* Personal Selling: one-on-one communication between seller and buyer to explain features and benefits of the product.
* Publicity: obtaining news coverage, creating a buzz, or generating favorable word-of-mouth about your product or service.

**Advertising**

Advertising is one of the most common methods of promotion used by businesses to communicate with customers about their products or services. It is similar to when you see an ad for a toy or game on TV, and it looks so cool that you ask your parents to buy it for you.

Some common advertising approaches include:
* TV commercials, radio ads, billboards, and print ads.
* Online advertising like search engine ads, social media ads, etc.
* Sponsorship of events or sports teams to promote a brand. 

Advertising aims to inform, remind or persuade customers about products or services through various mediums. It helps in creating brand awareness and directly influences sales.
