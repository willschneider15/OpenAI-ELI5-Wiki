# Game Theory

Game theory is like playing a game with rules to help you make decisions. Here's an example:

* Imagine you and a friend are playing Rock-Paper-Scissors.
* You each have to choose one out of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
* The outcome of the game depends on what you both choose.

Now imagine you're a business trying to make decisions that will affect your success. Game theory can help you make those decisions!

* Game theory is a way of understanding how people make decisions and the outcomes they lead to.
* It helps businesses understand how their decisions will affect their competition and how their competition may respond.
* Businesses can use game theory to create strategies that anticipate their competitors' responses and maximize their own success.

Overall, game theory is a way to strategically make decisions by understanding the goals and actions of others.
