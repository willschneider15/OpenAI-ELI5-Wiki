# Simulation

Simulation is like playing pretend with real-life situations. 

* It's a way for us to practice and test how different things might work out in the real world without actually having to go through them.
* Just like how you might pretend to be a chef or a doctor, simulation allows us to pretend to be business owners, traders, or investors.
* We can use simulations to make predictions or to see what might happen if we make certain choices in business or finance.
* Overall, simulation is a helpful tool for learning and practicing skills, without the risk or expense of real-world consequences.
