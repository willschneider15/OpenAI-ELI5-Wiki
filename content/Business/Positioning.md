# Positioning

Positioning is when businesses try to make themselves stand out and be noticed in the minds of customers. It's about creating a unique image or brand that makes people want to choose your product over others.

* **Think of it like a playground**: You want to be the kid with the coolest toy or the best game, so everyone wants to play with you.
* **It's like a puzzle piece**: Your business needs to fit into the right place in the market, by showing people how you're different from other businesses.
* **Imagine a crowded store**: You want to be the product that stands out on the shelf because you have something unique and special to offer.
* **Positioning is about finding your strengths**: What are you really good at? What does your business do better than anyone else?
* **It's about telling a story**: Creating an image in people's minds that tells them who you are, what you do, and why you're special.

If you can successfully position your business, you can create a loyal customer base that chooses you over the competition.
