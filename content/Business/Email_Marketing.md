Email Marketing Explained

Email marketing is when businesses use emails to send messages to people who are interested in their products or services. It's like sending a letter or a note but on the computer. 

Here are some things you should know about email marketing:

- It helps businesses communicate with customers and potential customers
- Emails can include information about new products, special offers, or important news
- It's a way to build relationships with customers by keeping them informed and engaged
- Email marketing can be more cost-effective than traditional advertising
- It's used by many businesses, big and small, in all kinds of industries
