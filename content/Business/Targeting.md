# Targeting

Targeting is finding the right people to sell something to. It's like inviting friends to a party; you only invite people you think will enjoy it, not everyone you know. In business, the product or service is the party, and the people who will enjoy it are called the target market.

* Targeting is important because it helps businesses make better decisions about what to sell and how to sell it.
* To find the right people, businesses need to know their wants and needs, and how they behave. 
* Targeting involves looking at factors like age, gender, income, location, interests, and lifestyle, to find the people who are most likely to buy the product or service.
* For example, if a company sells baby products, they might target new parents who are concerned about the safety and health of their babies.
* By targeting the right people, businesses can save time and money on marketing, while increasing their chances of making sales.
