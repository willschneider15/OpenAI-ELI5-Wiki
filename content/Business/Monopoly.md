# Monopoly

A Monopoly is when one person or company controls the entire market for a product or service. Imagine you had a toy that everyone wanted to play with, but you were the only one who had it. You could charge a really high price for someone to play with it because they have no other choice.

Similarly, a monopoly can:

* Charge high prices because they have no competitors
* Make products or services low in quality because no one else can do any better
* Limit choices for consumers to buy or use alternatives
* Control the entire market because there are no competitors

Governments often regulate monopolies or break them up because it's not good for the public or other businesses. For example, a few companies control the entire internet and if they didn't play fair, they could manipulate everything about how we surf the web.
