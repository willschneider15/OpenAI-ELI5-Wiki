# Elasticity

**Elasticity** is a concept that describes how sensitive people are to changes in prices, incomes or other factors that may affect their purchasing decisions. The basic idea is that when prices go up, people tend to buy less of something, and when prices go down, they tend to buy more. Here's a brief explanation of the different types of elasticity:

  * **Elastic demand** happens when a small change in price causes a big change in the quantity demanded. For example, if the price of a candy bar goes up from $1 to $2, people might stop buying candy bars altogether.
  * **Inelastic demand** happens when a big change in price causes only a small change in the quantity demanded. For example, if the price of prescription drugs goes up, people might still buy them even though they're more expensive.
  * **Unit elastic demand** happens when a change in price causes a proportional change in the quantity demanded. For example, if the price of gasoline goes up by 10%, people might reduce their consumption by 10%. 

In general, the more elastic the demand for a product, the more sensitive people are to changes in price. This can be important for businesses to understand when they're setting prices or deciding how to market their products.
