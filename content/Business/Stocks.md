# Stocks

Stocks represent the ownership in a company. When someone buys a stock, they own a small piece of that company. Companies sell stocks to raise money to grow their business. Owning stocks allows someone to potentially earn money in two ways:

- The company may pay out a portion of their profits to stockholders in the form of dividends.
- The stock price may increase, allowing the owner to sell the stock at a higher price than they bought it for.

However, stocks can also be risky investments. The stock price can go down, causing the owner to lose money. Some key things to keep in mind when investing in stocks are:

- Research the company before investing to make sure it is a solid company with potential for growth.
- Diversify your portfolio by investing in multiple companies, rather than putting all your money into one.
- Be patient and don't panic when the stock price goes down. It may recover over time.
