# PERT Charts

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart is a visual tool that helps plan, organize and track the tasks needed to complete a project. Here's a simple explanation for a 5-year-old:

- Imagine you want to bake a cake with your mom or dad
- First, you need to make a list of all the things you need to do: get ingredients, preheat the oven, mix the batter, put it in the oven and so on. 
- Then, you and your parents talk about how long each thing will take. For example, getting the ingredients might take 30 minutes, while preheating the oven will take 10.
- You draw a chart using circles to represent each task you need to complete, with arrows showing which task comes after the other.
- By connecting the circles with arrows, you make a pathway that shows how long it will take to complete the project.

PERT charts are very useful in business because:

- They help identify which tasks are critical, meaning they need to be completed on time to meet the final deadline.
- They show how long it will take to complete each task, making it easier to plan out the project timeline.
- They break down a project into smaller parts, making it more manageable and easier to coordinate among team members.
