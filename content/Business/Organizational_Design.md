# Organizational Design

Organizational design refers to the structure of an organization that outlines how various roles, responsibilities, and tasks are coordinated and divided. Just like how a house needs a blueprint to be built, an organization needs a design to be successful. 

Here's how I can explain this concept to you like you're 5: 

* An organizational design is like a puzzle that needs to be put together. 
* Each piece of the puzzle represents a different job or task within the organization. 
* If the pieces are put together correctly, then the organization runs smoothly and everyone knows what to do. 
* If the pieces are not put together correctly, then things can get confusing and people may not know what they are supposed to do. 
* So, an organizational design helps us see how everyone fits together and how they can work together to achieve common goals. 

In short, organizational design is important because it helps businesses align their structure with their goals and objectives. A well-designed organization can lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
