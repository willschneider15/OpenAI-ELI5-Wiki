# Cryptocurrencies

A **cryptocurrency** is like digital money, which can be used to buy and sell things online just like regular money.

* It is decentralized, which means there is no government or bank controlling it.
* Cryptocurrencies are based on a technology called blockchain, which creates a secure and transparent record of all transactions.
* Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are limited in supply. This means there is a fixed amount of them, which adds to their value.
* Examples of popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.
* Cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold on online exchanges, which allow people to exchange them for other currencies or products.
* It is important to note that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning their value can change quickly and dramatically.
* While some people see cryptocurrencies as a good investment opportunity, others are concerned about their lack of regulation and potential use for illegal activities.
