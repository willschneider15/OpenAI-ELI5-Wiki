# Regional Economic Integration

Regional Economic Integration refers to the coordination and combination of economic policies and agreements among different countries or states within a particular geographic region. In simpler terms, it is the process of countries coming together to form a stronger economic union. Here are the key points to understand:

* It helps to increase trade and investment between member countries by removing tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers
* Different forms of integration include free trade agreements, customs union, common market, economic union and political union.
* It encourages collaboration and cooperation among member countries, making it easier to share resources and expertise.
* It can help to increase the competitiveness of member countries in the global market, as well as attract foreign investment.
* However, it can also lead to job losses and industry closures in some cases as production shifts to member countries with lower labor costs.
