# Scrum

**Scrum** is a way of working on projects that helps teams stay organized and focused. It's like playing a game with your friends where everyone has a job to do to complete a puzzle, but the puzzle isn't finished until everyone has done their part! Here are some important things to know about Scrum:

* **Teamwork** is important - everyone works together to complete the project.
* **Goals** are set for each project, and everyone knows what they need to do to meet those goals.
* **Time is managed** - there are short time periods (called "sprints") when work is done, and everyone agrees on how much work can be done during that time.
* There are **daily meetings** where everyone talks about what they're working on and what they need help with.
* The **project manager** helps keep everyone on track and removes any roadblocks that might be in the way.

With Scrum, everyone knows what they need to do and when they need to do it. It helps to keep everyone focused and makes it easier to finish projects on time!
