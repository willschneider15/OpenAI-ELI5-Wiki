# Financial Statements

**Financial Statements** are documents that show how much money a company has made and how much money it has spent over a certain period of time. Think of it like a report card for a business.

There are three main types of financial statements:

* **Income Statement:** This shows how much money a company has made (called revenue) and how much money it has spent (called expenses) during a certain period of time, usually a year or a quarter. It then subtracts expenses from revenue to show the company's profit or loss for that period.

* **Balance Sheet:** This shows a company's assets (things it owns), liabilities (things it owes), and equity (money invested in the company by shareholders) at a specific point in time, usually the end of a year or quarter. 

* **Cash Flow Statement:** This shows the money flowing into and out of a company over a specific period of time, usually a year or quarter. It shows where a company's cash is coming from and where it's going, including how much money is being spent on investments, financing, and operations. 

Overall, financial statements can help managers, investors, and other stakeholders understand how a company is performing financially and make informed decisions based on that information.
