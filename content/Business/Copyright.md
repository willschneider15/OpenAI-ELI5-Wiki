# Copyright

Copyright is when someone creates something like a book, a song or a movie, they can decide who can copy or use it without permission. It is a legal right that creators of original work have to protect their work from being copied or used by others without permission. Just like how you wouldn't want someone taking your toy or your cookie without your permission, creators of work don't want others using their work without permission. 

Here are a few important things to remember about copyright:

- Copyright applies to lots of things like books, movies, songs, paintings and even computer software
- You don't have to do anything to get a copyright. Once you make something original, you automatically have it
- Copyright protects the original creator and gives them the right to say who can and cannot use their work
- If someone uses copyrighted work without permission, there can be legal consequences
