# Exchange Rates

Exchange rates refer to the value of one country's currency in relation to another country's currency. 

To explain exchange rates to a five-year-old, imagine you have two kinds of candies - ABC candies and XYZ candies. 

- ABC candies are the candies from the USA and XYZ candies are from Canada. 
- You can trade ABC candies for XYZ candies based on their value. 
- If one ABC candy can buy you two XYZ candies, then the exchange rate is 1:2. 
- Similarly, if one XYZ candy can buy you three ABC candies, then the exchange rate is 1:3. 
- The same applies to country currencies. 

In simpler terms, the exchange rate is like a barter system where one country's money is exchanged for another country's money. It is important because it affects things like:

- The price of imported goods
- How much money you get when you convert currency for travel
- The competitiveness of exports
- Global trade and investments.
