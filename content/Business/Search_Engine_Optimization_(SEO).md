# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs) such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. It helps search engines understand what your website is all about and rank it higher for relevant queries.

Here is how SEO works:

* Keywords: It all starts with choosing the right keywords that describe your business or website. Keywords are the search queries that people use to find information online. Google uses these keywords to match your website to a user's query.

* On-page optimization: This involves optimizing the content and HTML source code of each page of your website. For example, adding meta tags, header tags, and alt tags to make it easier for search engines to understand what's on the page.

* Off-page optimization: This involves building high-quality links from other websites to your website. The more relevant and authoritative the links are, the higher your website will rank.

* Analytics: SEO is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and evaluation. Analytics helps you identify which keywords and pages are driving traffic, and what changes you can make to improve your search engine rankings.

In simpler words, SEO helps your website or business get noticed by search engines and, in turn, by potential customers looking for what you offer.
