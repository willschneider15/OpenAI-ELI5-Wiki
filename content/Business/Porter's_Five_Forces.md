# Porter's Five Forces

Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing the competitive environment of a company or industry. It was created by Michael Porter, a business professor at Harvard University. I will explain the concepts simply, so you can understand them easily.

* The Five Forces are: 
  * The threat of new entrants
  * The bargaining power of buyers
  * The bargaining power of suppliers
  * The threat of substitute products or services
  * The intensity of competitive rivalry

* Imagine you are building a sandcastle and other kids come to play in the same area. The Five Forces help you understand the competition and make decisions about how to build the best sandcastle.

* New kids showing up to play can make it harder for you to build a great sandcastle. Similarly, the threat of new entrants in an industry can make it harder for companies to be successful.

* If the other kids have a lot of power when making decisions about what to do, they might change what you're building. This is the bargaining power of buyers -- how much control they have over the industry.

* The amount of sand available is like the bargaining power of suppliers. If there isn't enough sand available, it could make building a great sandcastle more difficult.

* If the other kids decide they don't want to build sandcastles anymore and start playing a different game, this is the threat of substitute products or services. In a business, this could be a different product or service that customers might prefer instead of what you're offering.

* Lastly, the intensity of competitive rivalry is like when the other kids are also building sandcastles and trying to make theirs the best. In business, this is how much competition there is between companies in an industry.

Overall, understanding Porter's Five Forces can help companies make better decisions and be successful in their industry.
