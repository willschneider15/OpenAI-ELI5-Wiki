# Project Control

Project Control is like driving a car.
 
* You start with a destination or goal in mind.
* You plan how you're going to get there by deciding on the route you'll take and how long it will take you.
* While you're driving, you keep checking your speed and how far you've gone to make sure you're on track.
* If you get lost or hit traffic, you adjust your plan and keep going.
* When you arrive at your destination, you compare your actual arrival time with your planned arrival time to see how well you did.

So in business, Project Control is the process of:

* Planning a project
* Tracking the project's progress
* Making adjustments to stay on track
* Evaluating the project's success at the end

Think of it like a road trip with your friends. You plan your route, make sure you have enough gas, and track your progress. If you hit traffic or take a wrong turn, you adjust your plan to stay on track. When you get to your destination, you celebrate your success!
