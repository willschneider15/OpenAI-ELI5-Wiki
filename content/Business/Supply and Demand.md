# Supply and Demand

Supply and Demand is the foundation of economics. They are two important factors that determine market prices. Here are the explanations:

**Demand**

* When you want something, you create demand for it
* Demand describes how much of a good or service people want to buy
* The higher the demand for a product, the more people want it
* For example, if Facebook announced a new phone, and everyone wants it, demand for this phone will be high, and everyone will be willing to pay a higher price to buy it
* On the other hand, if the demand for the product or service is low, the price will be low too

 **Supply**

* When you offer to sell something, you create supply
* Supply refers to how much of a product or service is available for sale
* When a company produces more products, it increases supply
* If there is too much supply and too little demand, the price will be low because people are not willing to pay more for a product they don't need
* If there is more demand than supply, businesses can increase their prices to make higher profits.

The interaction between supply and demand is what determines the market equilibrium price. When supply equals demand, the market is said to be in equilibrium. This system is the fundamental concept of economics and is applicable to all industries.
