# Kaizen

Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that means "continuous improvement." It is the idea of making small, incremental changes on a regular basis to improve processes, products, and services. Here are some examples of what it means:

* It is like taking small steps to climb a mountain instead of trying to jump to the top.
* It is like constantly making tiny adjustments to a bicycle to make it run better and smoother.
* It is like practicing a skill every day to get better and better at it over time.

Kaizen is used in many different industries, from manufacturing to healthcare to education. The goal of Kaizen is to make processes more efficient, reduce waste, and improve quality over time. By continuously improving, organizations can stay competitive and meet the changing needs of customers.
