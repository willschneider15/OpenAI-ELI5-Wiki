# Importing

**Importing** is when we bring things from other countries to our own country. People import things for different reasons. Sometimes we import things that aren't made in our country, and sometimes we import things because they're cheaper or better quality than what we have in our country.

Here are some examples of things that can be imported:

- Clothes made in China
- Electronics made in Japan
- Fruits from South America
- Cars from Europe

People who import things have to follow some rules. They have to pay taxes to bring things into the country. They also have to follow laws about what they can and can't bring into the country. This helps keep people safe and protects our economy.
