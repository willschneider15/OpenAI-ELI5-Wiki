# Mentoring

Mentoring is when a more experienced person helps and supports someone who needs guidance. Here are some easy-to-understand points to help you understand it better: 

- A mentor is like a teacher or a guide. 
- A mentor provides advice and shares their knowledge and experience with someone who is less experienced. 
- Mentoring can happen in different settings, such as in the workplace or in school. 
- Mentors can help mentees reach their goals or navigate difficult situations. 
- The relationship between the mentor and the mentee is built on trust and communication. 
- The mentor not only imparts knowledge and skills but also acts as a role model for the mentee. 
- Mentoring relationships can last for a short time or a long time, depending on the needs of the mentee. 
- Mentoring can have a positive impact on both the mentor and the mentee as it can lead to personal growth and development. 

So, in short, mentoring is just like having a wise and trustworthy friend with more experience who is there to help and guide you.
