# Market Equilibrium

Market equilibrium is when supply and demand are in balance, meaning that the amount of goods or services being produced and the amount of goods or services people want to buy are the same. Think about a seesaw, where the weight of the supply is on one side and the weight of demand is on the other side. When the seesaw is perfectly balanced, it's called the equilibrium point.

* The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity of goods supplied equals the quantity of goods demanded.
* At this price, buyers are willing and able to buy exactly the same amount that sellers are willing and able to sell.
* If the price is too high or too low, the equilibrium is disrupted, and either shortages or surpluses can occur.
* When there is a shortage, sellers realize they could have sold more goods if the price was higher, so they increase the price until they reach the equilibrium point.
* When there is a surplus, sellers realize they have too much inventory, so they decrease the price until the equilibrium point is reached. 

Understanding market equilibrium is important for businesses to know when to adjust their prices to stay competitive and profitable.
