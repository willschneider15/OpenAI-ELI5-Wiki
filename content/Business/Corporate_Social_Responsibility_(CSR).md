# Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)

Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR for short, is when companies try to do good things for the world besides just making money. They do this because they want to be good citizens and because it can help them with their business too. Here are some things that CSR can include!

- Making sure that the company doesn't harm the environment too much
- Helping out with social or community problems, like poverty or homelessness
- Trying to make sure that their employees are treated well and have good working conditions
- Giving money to charities or other good causes, like disaster relief

This concept is important because it shows that companies are more than just money-making machines. They can do good things for the world too!
