# Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT or Internet of Things is a fancy term used to describe a simple idea. It refers to the practice of connecting everyday devices, appliances or things to the Internet. 

Here's a way to explain IoT to a five-year-old:

* Imagine all the things you can turn on and off in your home, like your lights or TV
* Now, imagine you could control these from your tablet or phone, even if you're not at home
* That's what IoT is about - making things 'smarter' by allowing them to communicate with other devices 

In short, IoT connects devices to the internet, so that they can share data and work together. It allows you to control everything from one place, making our lives easier and more convenient. 

For example, if you forget to turn off your air conditioner when you leave your home, you can use your phone to switch it off. 

IoT is likely to change the way we live and work, with its endless possibilities and opportunities.
