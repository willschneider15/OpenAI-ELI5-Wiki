# Servant Leadership

### Servant Leadership

Servant leadership is a style of leadership where the leader is focused on serving others, rather than being served. 

* A servant leader prioritizes the needs of their team members, rather than their own needs or goals.
* They provide guidance, support, and resources to help their team members succeed.
* The goal of servant leadership is to empower and uplift others, and to create a positive, collaborative work environment.
* Servant leaders are empathetic, compassionate, and self-aware.
* They listen actively, communicate clearly, and build trust with their team members.
* Servant leadership is effective because it puts people first, and recognizes that a happy, supported team will perform better and be more productive.

Servant leadership can be used in all types of organizations and industries, and can help create a culture of respect, collaboration, and mutual support.
