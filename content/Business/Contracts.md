# Contracts

*A contract is a special kind of promise people make to each other. It can be a written or spoken promise that says, "I will do what I say I will do."*

Contracts have been used for many years to help people do business fairly. It is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Here are some important things to know:

* A contract can be written or verbal, but it is always better to have a written contract.
* A contract has three main parts: an offer, acceptance, and consideration.
* An offer is like saying, "I'll do something for you if you do something for me."
* Acceptance is when the other person agrees to the offer, saying "yes."
* Consideration is something of value that both parties agree to give or receive. It might be the money, goods or services being exchanged.

Contracts help protect everyone involved, as it sets expectations and obligations. If one party doesn't fulfill their side of the contract, the other party can sue them in court to make them comply. It's important to carefully read and understand the terms of any contract before signing it, and to seek legal advice if necessary.
