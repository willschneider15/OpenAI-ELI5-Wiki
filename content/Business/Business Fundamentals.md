# Business Fundamentals

Business fundamentals are the basics of running a business and they include:

- **Operations**: This means making, buying, selling, and delivering products or services to customers.
- **Finance**: This involves managing money, including budgeting, investing, and keeping track of financial records.
- **Marketing**: This is all about promoting and selling products or services to potential customers.
- **Human resources**: This is about managing employees, including hiring, training, and maintaining a positive workplace culture.
- **Strategy**: This means creating a plan for how to achieve long-term success and growth for the business.
 
Overall, business fundamentals are like the foundation of a house. Without a strong foundation, the house can't be built. Similarly, without a strong understanding of business fundamentals, a business can't be successful. Understanding and applying these fundamentals is crucial for anyone looking to start or grow a business.
