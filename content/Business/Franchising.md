# Franchising

**Franchising** is when a person or company (the franchisor) allows another person or company (the franchisee) to use their business model, name, and branding for a fee. 

Some common examples of franchising are:

- Subway
- McDonald's
- Marriott Hotels

Franchising is like borrowing someone else's recipe to make food. You use their ingredients and cooking instructions, but you still have to pay them for the right to use it. 

Some advantages of franchising include:

- Established brand recognition
- Proven business model
- Marketing and advertising support from the franchisor

Some potential disadvantages include:

- High initial investment costs
- Restrictions on how the business can operate
- Sharing profits with the franchisor.

In summary, franchising is a way for someone to start a business with the guidance and support of an established company.
