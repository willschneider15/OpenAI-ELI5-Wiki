# Crowdfunding

**Crowdfunding**

Crowdfunding is a way for people to raise money. Imagine having a big jar at home where you save money you don't want to spend. Crowdfunding is just like that jar, but online. Instead of saving money for yourself, you're putting it all together with other people's money for a big project. 

- People can use crowdfunding to ask for help raising money for things like starting a new business, making a movie or creating a product. 
- Many people all over the world can contribute a little money each. 
- Crowdfunding happens on websites like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, which let people create a page explaining their project and how much money they need. 
- People who give money to the project are called backers or investors. 
- In return for their help, backers might get a thank you email, a gift, or they might be among the first people to get to use the product or service the project is creating. 
- Anyone can be part of crowdfunding, but it's important to remember that not all projects are successful, so it's important to contribute carefully.
