International Business refers to the transactions, movements, and management of different types of companies and organizations in different countries. Here's a simple explanation:

* International Business means businesses that operate in more than 1 country.
* Companies that are located in 1 country can trade goods and services with companies in other countries.
* International Business includes export & import of goods and services, investments, and setting up businesses in different countries
* International Business uses tools like exchange rates, language translation, and cultural understanding to operate successfully.
* International Business can help to increase income for businesses, improve economic growth for countries, and increase employment opportunities.
* Businesses engaging in international trade must follow all laws, regulations, taxes, and customs in both the originating and destination countries.

International Business can exist on a small or large scale. Whether it's a small startup wanting to expand globally or a multi-billion dollar corporation with branches worldwide, the concept of international business remains the same.
