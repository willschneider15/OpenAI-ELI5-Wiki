# Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship is when an employee acts like an entrepreneur while working for a company. 

* Just like your mom or dad might run their own business, intrapreneurs look for new ideas and ways to grow the company they work for.
* They don't just do what they are told, they think of new and creative ways to solve problems and create value for the business.
* Intrapreneurs can be found at all levels of a company, from entry-level employees to top-level executives.
* They take calculated risks that can benefit the company in the long term.
* Intrapreneurship helps employees grow professionally and can help the company stay competitive in their industry. 

So, if you have a job and you come up with cool new ideas for your company, and you work to make those ideas happen, then you're acting like an intrapreneur!
