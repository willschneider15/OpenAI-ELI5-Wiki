# Sustainability

Sustainability means we must make sure we take care of the earth, so we can continue to live on it for a long time. Here are some things to remember:

* We must protect our planet's natural resources, such as trees, clean water, and air, so they don't run out.
* We need to be careful how much we use energy, like electricity and gas.
  * We can turn off lights when we leave a room, take shorter showers, and drive less.
* We must reduce, reuse, and recycle our waste, so we don't fill up landfills with things that could be used again.
  * We can choose to buy things that are made from recycled materials and recycle things like plastic bottles, paper, and cardboard.
* We need to be mindful of how our actions impact the environment, and make choices that help protect it for future generations.

Sustainability is about making choices that help protect the environment and ensure that we can continue to live on this planet for a long time.
