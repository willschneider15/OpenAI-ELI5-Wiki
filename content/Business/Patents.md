# Patents

A **patent** is a kind of exclusive right granted by the Government, in exchange for inventors' public disclosure of their inventions' details. Below are the basics of the patent concept made simple:

- A patent gives an inventor the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention for a certain amount of time (usually 20 years)
- Patents are given for new and useful inventions that are not obvious
- They can apply to machines, devices, chemicals, or even software programs
- A patent must be applied for and granted by the Government patent office
- Once granted, the inventor is responsible for enforcing the patent rights
- Patents can provide a competitive edge and protect an inventor's investment in developing a new product
- However, patents can also be expensive to obtain and defend, and their expiration can lead to increased competition and lower profits.

Patents have played a significant role in promoting innovation and economic growth worldwide by encouraging inventors to invest their time and resources into discovering new solutions to problems.
