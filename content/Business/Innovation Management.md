# Innovation Management

Innovation Management is a way to create new and better ideas in a company. It means finding ways to make products, services, or processes better, faster, or cheaper. Here are some key points to remember:

- **Innovation is not invention**. Invention means creating a new product, while innovation means improving upon it.
- **Innovation is essential to business success**. Without innovation, businesses can become stagnant and lose their competitive edge in the marketplace.
- **Innovation involves risk**. Trying something new always involves risks, but businesses must sometimes take calculated risks to reap the rewards of innovation.
- **Innovation requires a strategic approach**. Companies need to plan and prioritize their innovation efforts to ensure they align with their overall business goals and values.
- **Innovation involves collaboration**. Often, the best ideas come from bringing together different perspectives and experiences, so companies must create spaces and processes for collaboration and idea-sharing.

Overall, innovation management is about finding ways to drive creativity and create value for a business, its customers, and its stakeholders.
