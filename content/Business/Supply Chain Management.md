# Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain Management is like making a sandwich. You need different ingredients to make a sandwich. In the same way, companies need different products to make their final product. Supply chain management is the process of managing the way materials are sourced, transported, and delivered to the final product. 

Here are some key points to keep in mind about Supply Chain Management: 

* It involves the coordination of various activities, such as sourcing, production, and distribution.
* Companies aim to optimize their supply chain management to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
* The supply chain includes various parties, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.
* Proper management can help ensure that the right products arrive at the right place, at the right time, and at the right price.
* Different strategies, such as just-in-time (JIT) inventory, can help improve supply chain management.

Just like how a sandwich can't be made without the right ingredients, a final product cannot be made without proper Supply Chain Management.
