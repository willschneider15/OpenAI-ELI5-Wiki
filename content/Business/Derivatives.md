# Derivatives

**Derivatives**: Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset or benchmark. In simple terms, they are financial instruments that are based on or "derived" from something else, like a stock or commodity. It's like betting on something without actually owning it. 

**Types of Derivatives**:
* Futures: An agreement to buy or sell an asset at a future date and price. 
* Options: A contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a certain date. 
* Swaps: An agreement between two parties to exchange sequences of cash flows for a set period of time. 

**Why are Derivatives used?**
* To mitigate risk: Derivatives can be used to manage or hedge risks associated with investing, such as price fluctuations. 
* To speculate: Derivatives can also be used to speculate on the future price movements of an underlying asset. 

**Risks**
* Counterparty risk: The risk that the other party involved in the derivative contract may not fulfill their obligations. 
* Market risk: The risk of the underlying asset's price fluctuating in a way that is not favorable to the holder of the derivative. 

Overall, derivatives can be useful tools for managing risk and speculating on the future price movements of an asset, but they also come with inherent risks.
