# Recruitment

Recruitment is when a company tries to find new people to join their team. This is how it works:

* Companies put out a job posting to let people know they're hiring
* People who are interested in the job apply by sending in their resumes
* The company looks at the resumes to see who would be the best fit for the job
* They might do a phone or in-person interview to learn more about the person
* If the company likes the person, they will offer them the job!
* Then the new employee can start working and contributing to the company

Recruitment is important for companies because they need people to help them do their work. It's also important for people who are looking for a job so they can find a place to work that they enjoy.
