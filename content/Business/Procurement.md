# Procurement

Procurement is when a company buys things it needs to do its work. There are four main steps in procurement:

* **Identifying what is needed.** This means figuring out what the company needs to buy.
* **Sourcing.** This means finding out where the company can buy what it needs. The company might need to get bids from different suppliers to find the best price.
* **Negotiating.** This means talking to the supplier to agree on a price and other terms, like when the supplier will deliver the goods.
* **Purchasing.** This means actually buying the goods and paying for them.

 Procurement is important because a company needs to have the right materials, supplies, and services to do its work. Good procurement helps the company get what it needs at a good price, which can help the company make more money.
