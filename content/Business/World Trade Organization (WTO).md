# World Trade Organization (WTO)

The World Trade Organization, or WTO, is like a referee for trading between different countries. 

* What is it?
  * It is an international organization that deals with global rules of trade between nations.
* What does it do?
  * It helps make trade between different countries smoother by creating common rules and regulations
  * It also helps settle disputes between countries if they think a trading partner is not following the rules
* Why is it important?
  * It promotes free trade which can benefit countries by allowing them to import and export goods more easily without tariffs and quotas
  * It creates a more level playing field for smaller countries that may not have as much bargaining power without the WTO's rules and regulations
  * It helps prevent trade wars and promotes peace between countries by encouraging cooperation and understanding. 

By having the WTO, countries can work together and hopefully create a world where trade flows more easily which can ultimately benefit everyone.
