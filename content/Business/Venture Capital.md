# Venture Capital

### Venture Capital

• Venture capital is an investment in a company or startup with extraordinary growth potential.

• The investor - the venture capitalist - invests money in exchange for a share of ownership in the company. 

• Before investing their money, venture capitalists adopt a rigorous due diligence process.

• Venture capitalists will only invest if they believe that the company will be successful and grow quickly. They usually invest in the early stages of start-ups.

• They provide not just funds, but also advice, networks and other resources to help the start-ups grow quickly.

• A venture capitalist may stay involved in the company from its initial stages of inception to the point when it becomes a publicly traded company or has a significant merger or acquisition event.

• One of the primary goals of venture capital is to help the start-up grow their business quickly and become a profitable company. 

• In exchange for the services, the venture capitalist will want to have some say in the direction and operation of the company.
