# Inventory Management

Inventory management is when a store or business keeps track of all the things they have for sale. 

* It’s like keeping a list of all your toys so that you know which ones you still have and which ones you need to get more of.
* It’s important for businesses to keep track of their inventory so that they don’t run out of things customers want to buy.
* It also helps them avoid buying too much of something that won’t sell and taking up space.
* Businesses use special tools like barcodes and scanners to help them keep track of everything.
* This helps them know how much they have in stock, when they will run out, and when they need to order more. 

To summarize, inventory management helps businesses keep track of what they have, avoid buying too much or too little of something, and make sure they always have what customers want to buy available.
