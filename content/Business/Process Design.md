# Process Design

Process design is like a recipe to make something that you love to eat.

Imagine you're making pancakes for breakfast! The process design would be like the recipe.

* The recipe starts by listing all the ingredients you need to make the pancakes.
* Then it specifies the quantity of each ingredient like how many cups of flour, how many eggs, and how much milk.
* Next, it tells you how to combine these ingredients, mix it well, and in what order.
* Finally, it tells you how to cook the pancakes on the skillet or griddle, until they're golden brown and ready to eat.

Similarly, process design in a business:

* Lists all the inputs needed for the process like materials, labor, equipment, and technology.
* Specifies how to combine these inputs, like in which sequence or order.
* Describes how this process can be controlled so that the output is consistent and of desirable quality.
* And, finally details the monitoring activities that ensure the process yields the wanted output.

Without process design, businesses wouldn't know how to do things efficiently, with consistent output and high-quality results!
