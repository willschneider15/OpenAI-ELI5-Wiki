# Securities Regulation

Securities regulation refers to the laws and government agencies that oversee trading in stocks, bonds, and other investments. Here's what you need to know about it:

* Securities regulation is like a set of rules that help make sure everyone who invests their money is treated fairly.
* The government created these rules to help prevent people from being scammed or ripped off by dishonest sellers.
* Companies that sell stocks or bonds have to follow these rules, and they have to give investors lots of information about their business so they can make informed decisions.
* The government also has agencies, like the SEC in the US, that help make sure companies follow these rules and investigate any illegal activity in the market.
* All of this helps protect investors and make the market a safer and more trustworthy place to put your money.
