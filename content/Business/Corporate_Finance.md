# Corporate Finance

Corporate finance is how companies manage their money. 

Here are some things to remember about it:

- **Money In:** This is the money that the company makes from selling its products or services.
- **Money Out:** This is the money that the company spends on things like salaries, rent, and supplies.
- **Investments:** Companies can use some of their money to invest in new projects or acquisitions that will make them more money in the future.
- **Financing:** Sometimes companies need to borrow money to make investments or to pay for their day-to-day expenses. They can borrow from banks or sell bonds to investors.
- **Risk:** Whenever companies make investments or borrow money, there is risk involved. They need to make sure they are taking on the right amount of risk for their business.

In summary, corporate finance is about keeping track of a company's money, investing it wisely, and making sure there is enough money coming in to pay for everything.
