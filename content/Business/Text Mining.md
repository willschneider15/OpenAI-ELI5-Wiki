# Text Mining

Text Mining is when you take written words and use a special computer program to understand what they mean. 

- Picture that you have many books, but you don't have a lot of time to read them all. Instead, the computer program can read them for you!
- It looks for common themes, like what the books are about or how they feel. 
- The program takes out important information, like names or places, and puts it into categories so it's easier to understand.
- This is helpful for businesses because they might have a lot of customer reviews or feedback to read. Text Mining can help them quickly figure out what people like best or what they're complaining about. 
- It's also helpful for researchers who want to analyze what people are saying on social media or news websites. 

Overall, Text Mining is a way to quickly learn about big amounts of information!
