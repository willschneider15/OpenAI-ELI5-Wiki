# Logistics

Logistics is like arranging for things (products or services) to go from one place to another place.

* It involves figuring out how to move things in the quickest, cheapest, and most efficient way.
* This can include things like transportation, packaging, and storage.
* Logistics also involves planning and coordinating different stages of the process, from when the product is made to when it reaches the customer.
* It includes tracking inventory levels to make sure there's always enough of a product available.
* Good logistics means customers get their products on time, and companies save money by using the best transportation methods.
