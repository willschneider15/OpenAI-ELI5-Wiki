# Financial Institutions

Financial institutions are places where people take or borrow money and where they can save their money. They help you do a lot of things with your money, like:

1. Saving: Financial institutions let you save your money so you can use it when you need it. 

2. Borrowing: Some financial institutions let you borrow money, like banks or credit unions. You can use this money to buy a house or a car, start a business, or pay for school. 

3. Investing: Financial institutions let you invest your money. This means you use your money to buy things like stocks or bonds, which can earn you more money over time. 

4. Protection: Financial institutions can protect your money by offering insurance, which means they will pay you back if something happens to your money. 

There are different types of financial institutions, including: 

- Banks, like Wells Fargo or Bank of America
- Credit unions, like Navy Federal or America First
- Investment companies, like Charles Schwab or Fidelity
- Insurance companies, like State Farm or Progressive

Financial institutions help you manage your money and reach your financial goals.
