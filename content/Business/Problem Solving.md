# Problem Solving

### Explaining Problem Solving to a 5-year-old

Problem solving is when we try to figure out a way to fix something that's wrong. It's like finding a treasure map to get us to the treasure!

- A problem is like a puzzle that needs to be solved.
- We need to use our brains and think about different solutions to the problem.
- Sometimes we might need to try different things to see what works and what doesn't.
- It's important to keep trying and not give up!
- Once we find a solution, we can use it to fix the problem and things will be better.

For example, if we have a toy that's broken and we want to play with it, we have a problem to solve. We might try different things like putting it back together, using different tools, or even finding a new toy to play with. We keep trying until we find a solution, like fixing the toy or finding a new one, so we can play and have fun. That's problem solving!
