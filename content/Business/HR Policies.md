# HR Policies

***HR Policies Concept for Five-Year-Olds***

HR policies are rules that a company has about how workers should behave at work. Just like at school, there are rules about how we should behave, HR policies are rules for employers and employees when they are doing their work. 

Here are some of the most important things that HR policies can be about:

- *Time off work*: Everyone needs to take a break from work, HR policies will help to decide how many holiday days an employee has, or what happens when they are sick.

- *Safety*: Because safety is important, HR policies can be about how to stay safe at work or in emergency situations.

- *Behaviours and Discipline*: HR policies can help to decide what is the right and wrong way for an employee to behave at work. Rules about things like showing up on time, being polite, and not taking things that are not yours are some examples.

- *Pay and Benefits*: HR policies will help to explain what amount of money an employee will get paid, or what benefits they may receive as they do their work, for example, health insurance.

HR policies can be helpful for employers because they create a fair, consistent, and understandable work environment. Besides, they can help to keep employees safe and make them feel respected and appreciated.
