# Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is a way to promote businesses on search engines like Google. 

* SEM involves creating ads that show up on the search engine result page (SERP) when someone searches for specific keywords.
* Businesses bid on these keywords in a real-time auction to appear on the top of the SERP.
* The higher the bid, the more likely the ad will appear at the top of the page.
* Businesses only pay when someone clicks on their ad (cost-per-click), making this an efficient and cost-effective way to reach potential customers.
* SEM also includes optimizing a website's content and structure to improve organic search rankings (search engine optimization or SEO).
