Change management is how businesses make big changes without anything bad happening. Here are some things you should know:
- Businesses have to make changes sometimes to keep up with new things or to fix problems
- Change management is like a plan to make sure the change goes smoothly
- First, you have to know what the change is and who will be affected by it
- Then, you have to figure out how to tell people about the change and make sure everyone understands it
- Sometimes, you have to train people to do things differently because of the change
- Sometimes, you have to fix problems that happen because of the change
- Change management is important so that the business can keep working well and not have any big problems because of the change.
