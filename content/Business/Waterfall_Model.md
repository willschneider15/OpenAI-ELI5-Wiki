# Waterfall Model

The waterfall model is an approach in software development where each phase of the development process is completed one after the other.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

* **Requirements:** The first phase is to gather all the requirements of the software that is to be developed. Basically, what the software should do.
* **Design:** Next up, the team designs the software. This is where they figure out how the software will function taking into account the requirements. It's just like figuring out how a toy will work by drawing out what pieces will be needed and how they need to fit.
* **Implementation:** Following the design, the software is then implemented - this is where the team finally starts building the product.
* **Testing:** Once the software has been built, it's time to test it. This is done to make sure it behaves as expected and meets the original requirements.
* **Maintenance:** After implementing and testing the software, the team will then support and maintain it to fix any issues that might arise.

That's the basic idea behind the waterfall model!
