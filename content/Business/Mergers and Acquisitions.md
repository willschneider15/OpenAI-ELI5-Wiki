# Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions are two terms used when companies combine their businesses. Here's what they mean:

* **Merger**: This is when two companies join together to become one new company. Each company contributes its assets and liabilities to the new company. It's like when two friends hold hands and become one team.

* **Acquisition**: This is when one company buys another company. The buying company becomes the new owner and the acquired company becomes a part of the buying company. It's like when you buy a toy at the store, you become the new owner and get to play with the toy.

Some reasons why companies might choose to merge or acquire another company include:

* To grow their business and expand their products or services
* To gain a competitive edge in the market
* To access new markets or customers
* To streamline operations and reduce costs
* To acquire new technology, intellectual property or other valuable assets

Mergers and acquisitions can have a big impact on employees, customers and shareholders. It's important to consider all factors before entering into such a business deal.
