# Insurance

Insurance is a way to protect yourself from bad things that might happen. It is like wearing a helmet when you ride your bike so you don't get hurt. 

* Insurance is when you pay a little bit of money each month called a premium. 
* If something bad happens, like if you get sick or if you get into a car accident, the insurance company will help pay for the damage or the cost of getting better. 
* You need to choose the right insurance for you based on what you want to protect. If you have a car, you should get car insurance. If you get sick a lot, you might want health insurance. 
* Insurance is important because it can help you avoid big bills that you cannot afford. 
* You should always read the fine print and understand what the insurance covers and what it does not cover.
