# Occupational Health and Safety

- Occupational health and safety (OHS) refers to the protection of workers from potential hazards while carrying out job-related tasks.
- Hazards may include physical, chemical or biological dangers that may lead to injury, ill-health or death.
- OHS programs aim to prevent and reduce the likelihood of workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses.
- Employers have a legal and moral responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work environment for employees, which includes training, protective equipment, and regular safety inspections.
- This benefits both the employer and the employee, as it helps to minimize work-related costs, increase productivity, and create a positive workplace culture.
- A safe and healthy work environment can also lead to less time off work due to sickness, higher employee satisfaction and retention rates, and overall better performance for the company.
- OHS is an important part of any business or organization, as it helps to protect the well-being of those who work there, and contributes to the success of the company.
