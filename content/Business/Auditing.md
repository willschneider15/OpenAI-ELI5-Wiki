# Auditing

Auditing is like a check-up for a company's financial records. 

* Think of going to the doctor to make sure your body is healthy. 
* A company hires an auditor to make sure their financial records are accurate and truthful.
* The auditor goes through all of the company's financial statements, transactions and records.
* They make sure everything is in order and there are no mistakes or fraudulent activities.
* If there are any problems, the auditor will report back to the company and suggest ways to fix them.
* Auditing is important because it helps protect stakeholders' interests and ensures the company is following regulations and laws.
* It also helps build trust with investors and the public as they can rely on the accuracy of the company's financial statements.
