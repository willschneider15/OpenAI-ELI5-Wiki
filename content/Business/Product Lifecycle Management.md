# Product Lifecycle Management

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a way of managing a product from its birth to its end. Think of it as the journey of a toy car- from when it is first made, to when it is discarded. Here are the stages of product lifecycle:

* **Design:** This is the stage where the toy car is first imagined.
* **Development:** Now that the idea is in place, a team works to create the toy car using materials.
* **Introduction:** When the toy car is ready, it is introduced to the market.
* **Growth:** The popularity of toy car leads to increased sales and production. 
* **Maturity:** The market becomes saturated, sales growth slows down, and the product reaches the peak of its popularity.
* **Decline:** Finally, new products are created that become more popular, and the toy car is no longer being produced. It is out of date and is replaced by newer and improved versions.

PLM helps manage a product to maximize its performance and value for the entire time it is outside of the factory!
