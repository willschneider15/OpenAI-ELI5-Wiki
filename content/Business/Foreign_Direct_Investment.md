# Foreign Direct Investment

**Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** is when people or businesses from one country invest money, time, or resources into creating a business or purchasing assets in another country. This brings in outside money and expertise to the host country, potentially creating jobs, increasing economic growth, and improving technology and efficiency. Here's some key points to remember:

- FDI can involve the creation of new businesses, the expansion of existing ones, or the purchase of assets such as land, buildings, or equipment.
- The investor takes on risk by committing resources to a foreign country, but may also reap the rewards of new opportunities and higher profits.
- The host country benefits by receiving outside funding, which can boost economic growth and create jobs, as well as access to new technology and expertise.
- Some potential downsides of FDI include the risk of investors exploiting the host country by focusing on their own interests rather than the host country's interests, or the possibility of funds leaving the host country if the business fails.
- Governments can encourage or discourage FDI through policies such as tax incentives or regulations.
