# Capital Budgeting

Capital Budgeting is like deciding if you want to buy a toy or a candy with your allowance. Here's how it works:

* Capital Budgeting is the process of deciding which projects or investments to take on to maximize profits or meet goals. 

* It's like deciding how to spend your money, but instead of candy or toys, businesses decide on larger investments like buildings or equipment. 

* The process includes analyzing the potential costs and benefits of each investment. 

* This helps businesses make informed decisions about which investments to pursue and which to pass on. 

* It's important to choose wisely, because investments like these can have a big impact on a business's financial success in the long term. 

* By estimating the return on investment (ROI) and comparing it to the cost of the investment, companies can make sure that they are getting the best value for their money.

* In summary, Capital Budgeting is the process of making smart investment decisions that will help a business succeed in the long term.
