# Succession Planning

Succession planning is a plan that helps a company or organization make sure they have the right people in the right positions at the right time. It involves preparing for the future, especially if key leaders or employees leave the company. Here are some key points to remember about succession planning:

- It's important because it helps the company maintain stability and continuity.
- It can involve identifying and grooming current employees for leadership positions.
- It can also involve recruiting outside candidates who have the skills and qualities the company needs.
- Succession planning can help prevent disruptions if key personnel leave unexpectedly.
- It should be an ongoing process, not just a one-time event, because the company's needs and employees' skills may change over time.
- By planning for the future, the company can minimize risks and be better prepared for any challenges that may arise.
