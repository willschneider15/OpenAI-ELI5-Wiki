# Financial Ratio Analysis

Financial ratio analysis is a way of comparing different information about a company's finances to see how well the company is doing. 

Ratios are simply a way of expressing one piece of financial information as a fraction (or ratio) of another piece. There are different financial ratios that can tell us different things about a company:

- **Liquidity ratios** tell us whether a company has enough cash or assets that can easily be turned into cash to meet its short-term debts. 
- **Profitability ratios** tell us how much profit a company is making relative to its sales, assets or equity. 
- **Solvency ratios** tell us whether a company has enough assets to cover its long-term debts.
- **Efficiency ratios** tell us how well a company is using its assets and liabilities.

By looking at these ratios, investors, creditors and management can get a better picture of a company's financial health and past performance, which can help them make informed decisions about the company's future.
