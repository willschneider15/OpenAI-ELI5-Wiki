# Taxation

When you buy something from the store, you pay for it, right? Well, imagine if a little bit of that money you spent went to the government. That's what taxation is. Taxation is money that people and businesses have to pay to the government.

- Taxes help pay for things the government provides like schools, healthcare, and parks.
- The government collects taxes from different sources, like income tax. Income tax is a percentage of how much money people make from their jobs, businesses, or investments.
- Taxes can also be collected from buying things at the store. This is called a sales tax.
- Everyone who pays taxes helps to make their community better.
- Different countries and states have different tax rates, which means some people pay more or less taxes depending on where they live.
