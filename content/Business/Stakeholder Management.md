# Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management is making sure that everyone who has a certain interest or is affected by a company is happy. Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and these are your stakeholders:

- Customers: people who buy your lemonade 
- Investors: people who give you money to start your lemonade stand 
- Employees: people who help you make and sell your lemonade
- Suppliers: people who give you the lemons, sugar, water...

You want everyone to be happy, but since everyone has different wants and needs, you have to prioritise and compromise. 

- Customers want tasty lemonade and good service, but they won't pay more than they think it's worth. 
- Investors want a return on their investment, but they also want you to take care of your employees and not run out of supplies. 
- Employees want to be paid fairly, but they also want to work in a safe environment. 
- Suppliers want to be paid on time, but they also want you to keep ordering from them.

If you manage these different interests well, you'll be successful in the long run.
