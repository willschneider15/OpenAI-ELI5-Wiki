# Intellectual Property

Intellectual Property is like a special toy that belongs to someone. Just like you have ownership of your toy, some things can be owned by people and businesses because they made them. Here are some things that count as Intellectual Property:

* Games and apps
* Books, music, and movies
* Inventions and designs
* Logos and brand names

Nobody else is allowed to copy or use those things without permission from the owner. Just like how you wouldn't want someone to take your toy without asking, businesses don't want other people to use their things without asking. If they do, it's called "stealing" and it can be against the law. 

By protecting Intellectual Property, businesses can make sure that they get credit for their hard work and ideas. This can be really important for their success and their ability to keep creating new things. And just like how you wouldn't want someone to take your toy and break it, businesses don't want people to copy their ideas and make them worse.
