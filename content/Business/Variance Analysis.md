# Variance Analysis

Variance Analysis is like checking whether you did your work correctly.

* Imagine you got a math homework to solve.
* You got 10 problems to solve, but you only solved 8 of them.
* You have to check the answers of both, the homework you solved correctly and the ones you missed.
* You compare both to understand where you went wrong and to make corrections.
* The process of comparing and correcting is called Variance Analysis in the Business World.

Businesses do this too. They compare their budgets and actual expenses to see where they spent more or less than what they planned. Variance Analysis helps businesses make informed decisions and take corrective action when necessary.
