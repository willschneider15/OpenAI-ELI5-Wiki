# Business Model Canvas

The Business Model Canvas is like a puzzle. When you try to solve a puzzle, you need all the pieces to see the big picture. In the same way, businesses have different pieces that need to come together for the business to work. The Business Model Canvas helps businesses see how all the pieces fit together. 

Think of the Business Model Canvas as a big piece of paper. The paper is divided into boxes, and each box represents a different part of the business. The boxes include:

* Customer segments: Who the business is trying to sell to
* Value proposition: Why the business is better than its competitors 
* Channels: How the business is selling its products or services 
* Revenue streams: How the business is making money 
* Key resources: What the business needs to succeed 
* Key activities: What the business needs to do to succeed 
* Key partners: Who the business needs to work with to succeed
* Cost structure: How much it costs the business to operate

By filling out each box, businesses can see how all the pieces fit together and create a plan for success. Just like with a puzzle, businesses can use the Business Model Canvas to make sure all the pieces fit perfectly.
