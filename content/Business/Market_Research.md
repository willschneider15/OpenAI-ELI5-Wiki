# Market Research

Market research helps businesses understand their customers, so they can make better decisions about what to sell and how to sell it. It is like asking your friends what they want to eat before you plan a menu.

* It involves studying and gathering information about customers, products, and competition.
* Businesses use this information to create marketing strategies, develop new products, and improve existing ones.
* Market research can be conducted through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and online analytics.
* It can provide insight into:

  * Who the target customers are and what they want
  * How much people are willing to pay for a product
  * What features customers value most in a product
  * Who the competitors are and what they offer

* Market research is an ongoing process that helps businesses stay up-to-date on customer needs and preferences.
