# Market Segmentation

Market segmentation is when companies divide their customers or potential customers into smaller groups based on similar characteristics. 

* It helps companies personalize their marketing efforts and create products that meet the needs of specific groups of people.
* There are several ways to segment a market including geographic location, age, gender, income, and interests.
* For example, a toy company may target young children in one market segment and teenagers in another.
* Companies use market segmentation to differentiate themselves from their competitors and establish a unique selling proposition.
* It allows companies to tailor their marketing mix (product, price, promotion, and place) to each specific segment, which can lead to increased sales and profits. 

By effectively segmenting their market, companies can focus their resources and efforts on the most profitable segments and increase their chances of success.
