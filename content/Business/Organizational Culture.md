# Organizational Culture

Organizational culture refers to the set of shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and practices that govern how people act within a company. It shapes everything from how employees interact with each other to how they approach their work. Some key points to understand regarding organizational culture include:

- Every company has its own unique culture, and it's often influenced by factors such as leadership style, industry norms, and employee demographics.
- A strong culture can help create a sense of identity and purpose within a company, while a weak or toxic culture can lead to employee turnover and other negative outcomes.
- Cultural elements can include things like dress codes, office decor, employee perks, and the language used in internal communications.
- It can take time and effort to change a company's culture, and it often requires buy-in from leadership, employees, and other stakeholders.
