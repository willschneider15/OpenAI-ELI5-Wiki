# Oligopoly

Oligopoly is a simple concept. Imagine you and your three best friends have a lemonade stand. However, you and your friends are the only lemonade stands in your neighborhood. Since you are the only options for your customers, you and your friends have a lot of power to control the price of lemonade. If you set your prices too high, your customers might go to one of your friends' stands instead. But if you all agree to set a certain price, you could all make more money.

This is similar to how an oligopoly works in the real world. Oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of firms dominate the market, and they all have some control over the price of a particular product or service. 

Here are some key characteristics of an oligopoly:

- A small number of firms dominate the market.
- These firms can all influence the price of the product or service they offer.
- Entry barriers are high, meaning it's difficult for new firms to enter the market and compete.

Examples of industries that have oligopolies include:

- Mobile phone service providers
- Airline companies
- Gasoline/petrol providers

Overall, an oligopoly can result in higher prices for consumers and less competition in the market.
