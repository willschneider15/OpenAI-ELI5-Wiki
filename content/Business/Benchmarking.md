# Benchmarking

**Benchmarking** is a way to compare how well something is doing compared to others. It's like checking if you did better or worse than your classmates on a test. Here are key points to understand benchmarking:

- It's a way to identify best practices and areas for improvement
- It can be done internally (within a company) or externally (with other companies in the same industry)
- The goal is to learn from others and improve performance
- It's important to compare similar processes or products to get accurate results
- It can be used for various things such as improving customer service or reducing costs
- By setting goals based on the best performers, it helps ensure progress towards achieving desired outcomes

Remember, benchmarking is not about copying others, but rather using the knowledge and insights gained to improve and differentiate.
