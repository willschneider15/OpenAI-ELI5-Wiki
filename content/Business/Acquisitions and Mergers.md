# Acquisitions and Mergers

- Acquisitions and mergers are when two companies come together as one bigger company. 
- It's like when two friends join hands to build a bigger sandcastle instead of building two separate sandcastles. 
- When a bigger company buys a smaller company, it's called an acquisition. 
- When two companies of similar size combine, it's called a merger. 
- Companies do this to grow bigger and become more powerful or to expand into new markets. 
- Sometimes they do it to save money by combining resources and cutting costs. 
- But it can also be risky if the companies don't work well together or if the new company becomes too big and unstable.
- The process of acquisitions and mergers involves legal agreements, negotiations, and often requires the approval of regulators.
