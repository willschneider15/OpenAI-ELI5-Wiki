# Balance Sheet

A **Balance Sheet** is a financial statement that tells us how much a company owns (their assets) and owes (their liabilities) at a specific moment in time. 

* It is like a snapshot of a company’s financial health.
* It shows the company’s financial position by comparing what they own and what they owe.
* It helps us to understand the company’s liquidity, solvency, and ability to generate cash.
* It is divided into two main sections:
  * **Assets:** These are things that the company owns or has the right to use. This includes cash, inventory, equipment, buildings, and investments.
  * **Liabilities:** These are amounts that the company owes to others. This includes loans, accounts payable, wages payable, and taxes payable.
* The total assets must always be equal to the total liabilities plus equity (what the company’s owners have invested in the company). 
* The balance sheet is important for investors and analysts as it helps them to evaluate the risk and potential return of investing in a company.
