# Cost Accounting

**Cost accounting** is all about keeping track of how much money a business spends on making or selling a product or service. It is important because the cost of making or selling something affects how much money the business earns.

Here are some things you should know about cost accounting:

* Cost accounting helps businesses figure out their expenses and costs related to production, such as materials used, labor costs, and overhead expenses.
* It helps managers make decisions about pricing, production, and inventory. This is because the cost accounting information shows how much money is going in and out of the business, and what it costs to produce a product or service.
* It also helps businesses determine how much profit they are making or whether they need to reduce the cost of production so that they can keep the prices competitive or increase their earnings.
* In summary, cost accounting helps companies keep track of their expenses, manage production costs, improve efficiency, make informed decisions, and, ultimately, increase profits.
