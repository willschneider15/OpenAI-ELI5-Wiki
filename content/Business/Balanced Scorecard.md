# Balanced Scorecard

The Balanced Scorecard is a tool that helps companies keep track of their overall performance in order to achieve their strategic goals. It does this by looking at four different perspectives: 

* Customer Perspective - how satisfied are our customers? 
* Financial Perspective - how profitable are we? 
* Internal Business Process Perspective - how efficient are our processes? 
* Learning and Growth Perspective - are we developing our employees and using new technology effectively? 

By measuring and tracking progress in these four areas, companies can see if they are on track to achieving their strategic goals. This approach allows companies to not only focus on financial metrics, but to also take into account the perspectives of customers, employees, and internal processes. 

To summarize, the Balanced Scorecard is a tool used by companies to keep track of their overall performance in achieving strategic goals through four different perspectives: customer, financial, internal business process, and learning and growth.
