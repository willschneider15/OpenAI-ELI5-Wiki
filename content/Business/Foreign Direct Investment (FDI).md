# Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is when a business or a person from one country invests their money in another country. Imagine you have a piggy bank with a lot of money saved up. If you put some of that money into your friend's piggy bank, that's like FDI!

Here's some more information to help you understand FDI:
* It's a way for businesses to expand and grow globally by investing in other countries.
* Sometimes a business wants to do more than just sell their products in a different country. They want to build factories, offices, or stores in that country too.
* FDI can help the country receiving the investment because it can create jobs and bring in new technology or expertise.
* The investor business might benefit too, by gaining access to new markets, resources or cheaper labor.
* FDI can be a big decision for a business to make, because there can be risks involved, such as changing government policies or cultural differences.

Overall, FDI is a way for businesses to invest their money in other countries and can bring benefits to both the investor and the country receiving the investment.
