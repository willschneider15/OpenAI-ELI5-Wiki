# Business Planning

Business planning is like creating a plan before playing a game. When you plan beforehand, it helps you identify what steps you need to take to succeed in your game.

Similarly, in business, planning is a process of creating a roadmap that helps businesses achieve their goals by outlining what needs to be done, when it needs to be done and how.

Here are a few things to remember about Business Planning:

- It involves identifying goals and objectives for the business
- It outlines the strategies that will help you achieve the goals
- It helps you understand the market you wish to operate in
- It shows how you plan to finance the business
- It includes timelines for achieving the goals, and how you measure success.

Business Planning is like a compass that helps navigate a business towards success. With a well-thought-out plan, businesses can make informed decisions that can make all the difference in how they achieve their goals.
