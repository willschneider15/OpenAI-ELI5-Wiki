# Onboarding

Onboarding is when a new employee starts working at a company, and the company helps them understand how everything works so that they can do their job as best they can. It's like when you start kindergarten and your teacher shows you where your classroom is, where your locker is, where the bathroom is, and how to use your crayons. 

Here are some things that companies might do as part of onboarding:

* Show the new employee around the office or workplace
* Introduce them to their coworkers and managers
* Give them all the information they need to start doing their job, like how to log in to their computer, who to talk to if they have a question, and what their daily tasks will be
* Tell them about the company's culture and values, like how important teamwork is or what their goals are
* Train them on any skills they need to learn, like how to use a certain program or how to make a sales pitch
* Finally, make sure the employee knows who to talk to if they need help or have any concerns

By doing all of these things, the company helps the new employee feel welcome and prepared to do their job well.
