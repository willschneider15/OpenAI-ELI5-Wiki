# Cash Flow Statement

There is something we use when keeping track of money in a business. Do you know what a piggy bank is? A piggy bank has a small hole that you put money into and the money stays inside. A Cash Flow Statement is like a piggy bank for businesses. 

Let me break it down for you. 

* A Cash Flow Statement helps a business keep track of where their money goes. 
* Money that comes in from things like selling goods or services is called "Cash Inflows." 
* Money that goes out to pay for things like rent, supplies or employees is called "Cash Outflows." 
* We use the Cash Flow Statement to know if the business has more money coming in than going out or if it is losing more money than it is making. 
* This is important because if a business is not making enough money, it will not be able to keep operating. 

So, a Cash Flow Statement is like a piggy bank where businesses keep track of how much money they have coming in and out. This helps them know if they have enough money to keep going or if they need to make changes to bring in more money.
