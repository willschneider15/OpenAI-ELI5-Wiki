# Project Monitoring and Control

Project Monitoring and Control is all about making sure a project stays on track and stays within the budget that has been set. Here's a little bit more about what it involves:

* **Being aware of the project's progress:** You need to keep track of where the project is up to so that you can make sure it's still on schedule.
* **Sticking to the budget:** You also need to make sure that the project is staying within the budget that has been set. You don't want to spend too much money on the project because that will lead to problems down the track.
* **Identifying problems and issues:** It's important to be aware of any problems or issues that come up during a project. That way you can fix them quickly and make sure they don't affect the project's progress.
* **Taking corrective action:** If there are problems or issues with a project, you need to take action to fix them.
* **Keeping stakeholders informed:** Finally, you need to keep everyone who is involved in the project informed of how it's progressing. This helps to make sure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no surprises down the track.
