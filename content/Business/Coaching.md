# Coaching

Coaching is when someone helps you learn something new or get better at something you already know how to do. They give you advice and show you different ways to do things. 

* It's kind of like having a personal trainer for your brain!
* A coach can be someone at school, a sports coach, or even someone at work.
* They ask questions to understand what you want to learn or improve.
* They help you set goals and make a plan to achieve them.
* They give you feedback on how you're doing and help you adjust your plan when needed.
* A coach is like a supportive friend who wants to see you succeed! 

Having a coach can be really helpful because they have more experience than you and can help you avoid making mistakes. They also believe in you and can help you believe in yourself!
