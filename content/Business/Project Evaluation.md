# Project Evaluation

Project evaluation is like checking if you did well on a test or an assignment in school. 

* It is a process of assessing a project's performance and outcomes
* This helps to determine whether the project was successful or not
* Project evaluation considers multiple aspects such as the time it took to complete the project, the resources used, and the costs involved
* It also determines whether the project achieved its goals or objectives
* Based on the project evaluation, adjustments can be made to improve future projects
* It is important to evaluate projects to learn from successes and failures, and to make better decisions moving forward
* Evaluation can also help in determining the future viability of a project

In essence, project evaluation is a way to measure the success of a project and to identify areas where improvement can be made. By evaluating projects, we can ensure that we are making efficient use of resources, achieving our goals, and improving our decision-making process.
