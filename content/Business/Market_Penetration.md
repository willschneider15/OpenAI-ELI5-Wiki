# Market Penetration

Market penetration is a business strategy that companies use to sell more products to an existing customer base in a current market. 

* Think of it as trying to sell more of the same product to people who already buy it.
* Companies use various strategies, including promotions and discounts, to encourage customers to keep buying their products.
* Market penetration can help businesses grow their market share and increase their revenue without having to create new products or find new customers.
* This strategy is often used in mature markets or industries where the potential for new customers is limited.
* One potential downside is that it can reduce profit margins if companies have to lower prices or offer incentives to keep customers buying. 

In simpler terms, it's like trying to convince your friends to buy more candy bars from the candy store they already visit instead of trying a different one. The store hopes that by making the candy bars more appealing or cheaper, they can keep their customers buying from them for longer.
