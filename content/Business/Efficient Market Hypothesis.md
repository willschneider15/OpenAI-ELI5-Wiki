# Efficient Market Hypothesis

Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a theory that suggests that financial markets are efficient and securities already reflect all available information. What does that mean? Here are some key takeaways:

- EMH suggests that it's impossible to beat the market consistently because all relevant information is already incorporated into stock prices.
- This means that stock prices instantaneously and continuously adjust to new information, making it difficult for investors to make profits through analyzing information and predicting stock trends.
- EMH comes in three forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong, with each form suggesting different levels of efficiency based on the types of information that are incorporated into stock prices.
- Weak efficiency implies that the past trading will not predict the future trends, Semi-strong efficiency suggests that publicly available information such as balance sheets, income statements is already incorporated into stock prices, and strong efficiency states that even insider information cannot be used to gain an advantage because it is immediately reflected in stock prices.
- EMH theory has been criticized by many scholars for ignoring trader behavior and the possibility of psychological biases affecting investor decision-making.
