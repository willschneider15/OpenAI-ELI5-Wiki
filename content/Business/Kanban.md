# Kanban

Kanban is a tool used in production and manufacturing to visualize and manage workflow. Imagine you own a toy factory that produces toy cars. You have different stages in producing the toy - molding, painting, assembling, packing. You use a board called a Kanban board that has columns for each stage. 

* You write the orders on cards and attach them to the board in the first column, which represents the molding stage. 
* When the workers in the molding stage finish making the order, they move the card to the next column which represents the painting stage. 
* This process repeats until the final column which represents the packing stage. 
* Once the order is packed and sent out, the card is removed from the board.

Kanban boards are used because they allow you to:

* visualize and manage workflow
* easily see the status of orders 
* identify and remove bottlenecks in production 
* increase efficiency and productivity 
* help manage inventory
