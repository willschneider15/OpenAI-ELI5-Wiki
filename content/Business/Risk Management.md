# Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and handling potential risks or uncertainties that may affect a person or a business's operations or objectives. It involves planning for and taking steps to minimize potential losses or damages that might occur from unexpected events.

Here are some key points about risk management for a five-year-old:

- Risk management means being careful about things that might go wrong.
- It's like putting on a helmet before you ride your bike to protect your head in case you fall off.
- Companies use risk management too, to avoid losing money if something bad happens.
- They might identify risks like fires, floods, or unexpected changes in prices.
- Then they'll figure out how to reduce those risks, like installing smoke detectors or buying insurance.
- Finally, they'll have a plan in case something goes wrong, like a fire escape route or emergency supplies.
- By managing risks, people and businesses can stay safe and avoid big problems.

In summary, risk management is a way to stay safe and avoid big problems by identifying potential risks, reducing them as much as possible, and having a plan in case something bad happens.
