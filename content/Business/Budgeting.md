# Budgeting

**Budgeting** is making a plan for your money. 

It's like deciding how many candies you can buy with the money you have.

* **It helps you keep track of your money:**
	* Budgeting tells you what money you have, what money you will get, and what money you will spend.
	* You know where your money is coming from and where it's going.
	* You can set aside some money for emergencies or for the future.
* **It helps you spend money wisely:**
	* Budgeting helps you see if you're spending more money than you have or if you're spending money on things you don't need.
	* You can plan ahead for big purchases like a new toy or a new phone.
	* You can avoid getting into debt or owing people money.

Budgeting is important for people of all ages. It's a way to make your money work for you and not the other way around.
