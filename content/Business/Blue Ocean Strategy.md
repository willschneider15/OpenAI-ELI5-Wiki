# Blue Ocean Strategy

The **Blue Ocean Strategy** is a way that companies can create their own market space where competition is irrelevant. It is the opposite of the Red Ocean Strategy where companies continually fight against each other in bloody and saturated marketplaces. Here are the key points to remember about the Blue Ocean Strategy:

- It's about creating **new markets** where demand is created rather than fulfilling demand in established markets.
- Companies utilizing this strategy focus on **innovation** instead of beating the competition. By creating a new market, they have no competition. 
- It's about creating **value** for both the company and customers. This means providing a product/service that meets a need that hasn't been met before. 
- The Blue Ocean Strategy aims to find a **balance** between differentiation and low cost. Companies that can create a unique product or service that is also affordable, are more likely to succeed.

In summary, the Blue Ocean Strategy is a way for companies to create an uncontested marketplace by focusing on innovation, value creation, and balancing differentiation with cost. By creating a new market space where competition doesn't exist, companies have the potential to increase their profits and gain a competitive advantage.
