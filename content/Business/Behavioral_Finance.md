# Behavioral Finance

Behavioral finance is a way to understand how people make decisions with their money. Here are some ways to think about it:

* Sometimes people make financial decisions that don't seem to be the most rational or logical.
* Behavioral finance tries to explain why people make these decisions.
* It looks at things like emotions, biases, and other factors that can influence decision-making.
* For example, someone might make an investment decision based on their gut feeling instead of looking at the numbers and doing research.
* Understanding behavioral finance can help people make more informed decisions with their money and avoid common mistakes.
