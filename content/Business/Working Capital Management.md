# Working Capital Management

Working Capital Management (WCM) is the management of a firm's short-term assets and liabilities necessary to run its regular business operations. In simpler terms, it means managing the company's money for the short term. 

Managing working capital requires a balance that involves maintaining sufficient cash flow, payables and receivables, and inventory. 

Companies use WCM to ensure that they have enough financial resources for their daily operations without needing external sources of funding. This ultimately helps companies to:

* Meet immediate financial obligations
* Avoid cash shortages
* Pay off debts towards credit lines
* Control the cost of financing.

The main components of working capital management include cash, account receivables, inventory, and accounts payable.

* Cash: Money available that can be used to cover day to day expenses.
* Account receivables: Money the company is owed by customers in the short term.
* Inventory: Business goods and materials for the company.
* Accounts payable: Amount due to be paid to suppliers within the short term.

Effective working capital management can lead to improved growth, strategic investments, and a reduction of financial risk.
