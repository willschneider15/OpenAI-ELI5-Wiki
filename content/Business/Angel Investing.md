# Angel Investing

Angel investing is when a person with money (called an angel investor) gives some of that money to a new business. Here is how it works:

- A person has an idea for a business, but they need money to make it happen.
- They find an angel investor who believes in the idea and is willing to give them money to help start the business.
- In return for the money, the angel investor gets a percentage of the business.
- If the business does well and makes money, the angel investor gets a share of that money too.

Angel investing can be a great way for new businesses to get the money they need to get started. It can also be a good investment for the angel investor if the business is successful. However, it is important to remember that investing in new businesses is risky and not every business will be successful. That is why it is important for the angel investor to do their research and make sure they are comfortable with the risks before investing their money.
