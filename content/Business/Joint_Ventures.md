# Joint Ventures

A joint venture is when two or more companies work together on a project or business venture. It's like a team of people working together to achieve a common goal. 

Here are some key points of joint ventures:

* Two or more companies come together and pool resources to create a separate company to run a specific project or business.
* Each company brings different strengths, like expertise, technology or money, to the joint venture.
* The joint venture is a separate legal entity with its own set of assets and liabilities.
* The companies involved in the joint venture share the profits and losses equally.
* Once the project or venture is complete, the joint venture may be dissolved, or it may continue with the companies involved taking on different roles.

Joint ventures are a way to achieve a common goal through collaboration, pooling resources and sharing risk. They can be a great way for companies to take on bigger projects than they could on their own, and to bring different strengths and expertise to a project.
