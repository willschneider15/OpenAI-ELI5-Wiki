# Data Visualization

Data visualization is when you turn boring numbers and information into pictures that help you understand what it really means. 

- It's like posting a picture of your pet instead of just telling your friend what your pet looks like
- Instead of staring at a long list of numbers, you get to see it in a way that makes sense to you
- Lots of different things can be visualized, like graphs, charts, maps, and even videos
- It helps you get the "bigger picture" without having to read through all the fine print
- It's important in business because it can help you make better decisions and communicate ideas more effectively 

In short, data visualization is a way to make data more interesting, understandable, and useful.
