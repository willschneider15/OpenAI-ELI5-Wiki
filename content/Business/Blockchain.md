# Blockchain

## The Concept of Blockchain

* Blockchain is like a digital notebook. 
* Imagine your friends and you have the same notebook with the same information on each page. 
* Every time someone writes a new piece of information in the notebook, it gets added to every copy of the notebook. 
* This means if anyone tries to change what's written in the notebook, everyone will know because their copies won't match. 
* Each page in the notebook is called a "block." 
* People can add more blocks to the notebook, making it longer and longer, but they can't change any of the old blocks. 
* Each block contains a unique code, kind of like a fingerprint, called a "hash" that helps keep the notebook secure.
* Blockchain works the same way, except instead of notebook, it's a digital database that can store all kinds of information from money to voting records.
* And just like with the notebook, once information is stored in a block, it cannot be altered or deleted.
* This makes blockchain a secure and trustworthy way to store and share information without the need for a middleman, like a bank or government.
