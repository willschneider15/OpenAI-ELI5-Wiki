# Currency Risk

Currency risk refers to the possibility of losing money due to changes in the value of currencies. This usually happens when a company or an individual trades or invests in different currencies. Here are some key points to understand the concept of currency risk explained in simpler terms:

- Imagine you have 5 toy cars that you want to sell to your friend in another country. You agreed to sell the toy cars for $5 each, but the exchange rate changes and now the value of the currency in that country decreased. This means that if you still sell the toy cars at $5 each, you will receive less money in your own currency.
- Currency risk affects not only individuals selling toy cars, but also businesses trading goods and services internationally, as well as investors purchasing stocks, bonds or other financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
- Currency risk can be divided into transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk.
- Transaction risk occurs when a business agrees on a trade in a different currency and there is a risk of exchange rates fluctuating between the agreement and execution.
- Translation risk is the risk that arises when a business consolidates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries using a different currency.
- Economic risk is the risk that arises due to changes in the underlying economic factors, such as interest rate differentials, inflation rates, GDP, and political stability. 

In summary, currency risk is the possibility of losing money due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Understanding currency risk is important for businesses and investors who deal with multiple currencies as it can affect profits and investments.
