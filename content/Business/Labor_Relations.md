# Labor Relations

Labor relations is all about how workers (people who have jobs) and their employers (the people who pay them) have a relationship with each other. Here's what you need to know:

- Workers want to be treated fairly and paid well for the work they do.
- Employers want to pay their workers as little as possible so they can keep more money for themselves.
- Sometimes workers form groups called unions to help them work together to get better pay and better working conditions.
- Unions can negotiate with employers to try to get better pay, benefits, and working conditions for workers.
- Sometimes this negotiation involves strikes, which is when workers refuse to work until things improve.

Basically, labor relations is all about how workers and their employers work together (or don't work together) and how they negotiate with each other. It's an important part of business because it affects how much workers get paid and how happy they are at work.
