# Selection

**Selection** is a process that businesses use when they want to pick the best employee for a job. Imagine playing "duck, duck, goose" with your friends. Before you tag someone as the goose, you look at all your friends and decide which one is the fittest, faster or looks ready to go. That’s similar to what businesses do when selecting an employee. They follow a process to look at all the applicants and decided on the best one. 

Here's how it works:

* Businesses start by advertising the job.
* People then apply for the job by sending their résumé and other application materials.
* The hiring staff will then asses if the candidate has the skills and experience for the job
* Then, the candidates are called for an interview where they will answer questions about their skills, interests, and experience.
* Finally, the business selects one person who they think is the best match for the job.

When selecting someone for a job, businesses should consider a candidate's experience, education, and personal characteristics that would make them successful in the role. By following the process of selection, businesses can find the best people to fill their job openings.
