# Activity-Based Costing (ABC)

Activity-Based Costing or ABC is just like playing with Legos! Let me explain:

* Legos come in different shapes and sizes, just like the products and services companies produce.
* To build something with Legos, you need different pieces, just like companies need different resources to produce products and services.
* Legos can be expensive, especially if you use a lot of different pieces, just like producing some items may require more resources and be more expensive than others.
* Sometimes itâ€™s hard to understand how many pieces you need to build something, just like companies struggle to understand all the resources and costs that go into creating a product or service.
* ABC helps companies understand the specific resources and costs that go into creating each product or service by breaking down the production process into individual activities and then assigning costs to each activity.

So, ABC is like taking apart a Lego creation to see how many pieces are needed and how much each piece costs. This helps companies better understand their costs and make more informed decisions.
