# Outsourcing

Outsourcing is when a company hires another company to do some work for them. Here are some examples of what that might look like:

* A company might outsource their customer service to another company that specializes in helping customers with problems.
* A company might outsource their manufacturing to another company that can produce the products more efficiently and at a lower cost.
* A company might outsource their IT support to another company that can provide better technology services.

Outsourcing can have benefits for companies, such as:

* Cost savings: outsourcing can often be cheaper than doing everything in-house.
* Access to expertise: outsourcing allows companies to hire experts in a specific area without having to employ them full-time.
* Efficiency: outsourcing can allow a company to focus on their core competencies and leave the other stuff to specialists.

However, outsourcing can also have some downsides, such as:

* Loss of control: outsourcing means that the company doesn't have 100% control over the work being done.
* Communication issues: outsourcing requires good communication between the two companies, which can sometimes be difficult.
* Ethical concerns: outsourcing can sometimes involve working with companies that have lower standards for things like labor practices.
