# Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is how the government controls the amount of money in the economy. It's like a parent giving you an allowance - they decide how much money you get, and can change it depending on how they want you to behave. It works like this:

* When the economy is doing well, the government might decrease the amount of money in the economy by raising interest rates. This makes it harder for people to borrow money, which encourages them to save instead of spend.
* When the economy is struggling, the government might increase the amount of money in the economy by lowering interest rates. This makes it easier for people to borrow money, which encourages them to spend more.
* The government can also directly control the amount of money in the economy by buying or selling bonds. When they buy bonds, they put more money into the economy. When they sell bonds, they take money out of the economy.

Overall, monetary policy is a way for the government to control the economy by adjusting the amount of money in it.
