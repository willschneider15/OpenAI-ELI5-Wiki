# Critical Path Method

Critical Path Method (CPM) is a project management tool that helps to identify the most important tasks in a project to complete it on time. It is useful to manage both simple and complex projects. CPM determines the path which takes the longest time to complete the project known as critical path. 

### Steps of Critical Path Method

* **Task Identification:** Identify all the tasks required to complete the project.
* **Task Sequencing:** Determine the sequence of all tasks that need to be completed.
* **Task Duration:** Decide on the estimated time required to complete each task.
* **Critical Path Identification:** Identify which tasks are critical to the completion of the project, based on time to complete and dependencies.
* **Resource allocation and levelling:** Allocate the necessary resources for each task and determine if there are any resource constraints that need to be resolved.
* **Project Schedule:** Schedule the timing of all tasks to complete the project successfully.


### Benefits of Critical Path Method

* Helps to identify the critical tasks that are essential to complete the project on time and within budget
* Helps to prioritize the tasks based on their importance
* Helps to allocate resources more efficiently
* Helps to identify the minimum amount of time required to complete the project
* Helps to identify all possible delays affecting the project

### Conclusion

Critical Path Method is a powerful management tool and essential to complete project in the planned time frame.
