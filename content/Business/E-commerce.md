# E-commerce

E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is like going to a store on the computer. Instead of going to an actual store, you can buy things online! 

Here's how it works: 

- People open online stores using websites. These stores are like normal stores, but on the internet.
- You can search for products on these online stores using a search bar, just like you would in a physical store. 
- When you find what you want to buy, you add it to your digital shopping cart. 
- Then you "check out" by entering your payment information and shipping address. 
- Finally, the store will send your purchase to your home. 

E-commerce makes shopping very convenient. You can buy things from anywhere and at any time without having to leave your house. Many businesses have also started using e-commerce to sell their products because it's easier to manage inventory and it allows them to reach customers all over the world.
