# External Communication

External communication is how a business talks to people outside of the company. Almost every business needs to use external communication. Here are some things you need to know:

* External communication is not just talking. It can also be a business writing an email, sending a text message or even making a social media post.
* When a business wants to talk to someone outside the company, it can be for all kinds of reasons. One common reason is to sell a product or service. Others include sharing news, asking for feedback, or sending invoices.
* Different people outside the business will want to know different things. For example, customers may want to know about new products or services. Investors may want to know about the business's financial health. Suppliers may want to know about changes to orders or shipping times.
* It is important for a business to communicate clearly and professionally. If people outside the business do not understand what is being said, they may not want to work with the business again.
