# Project Planning

Project planning is the process of figuring out what needs to be done, how it will be done, and who will do it. It's like making a recipe for a cake, but for a project instead. Here are some key concepts to keep in mind:

* **Goals:** Project planning starts with figuring out what you want to achieve. Just like you decide you want to bake a cake, you need to know what you want your project to accomplish.
* **Tasks:** Once you know what you want to achieve, you need to break it down into smaller tasks that need to be completed. This is like figuring out what ingredients you need for your cake and how long it will take to bake.
* **Timeline:** You need to figure out when each task needs to be completed and how long it will take. This is like figuring out when to start making the cake and how long to bake it.
* **Resources:** You need to figure out what resources you'll need to complete each task, such as people, materials, and equipment. This is like determining what tools and ingredients you'll need to make the cake.
* **Budget:** You need to figure out how much money you'll need to complete the project. This is like figuring out how much it will cost to buy ingredients for the cake.

Overall, project planning helps ensure that your project is organized, efficient, and successful.
