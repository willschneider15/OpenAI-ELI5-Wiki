# Operations Strategy

**Operations Strategy** is the plan that a business uses to make its products and services. It involves deciding how to make goods, where to make them, how to deliver them, and how to improve processes by using better methods, tools and technologies.

* At the heart of an operations strategy is the production process. This process should be structured to optimize the use of resources while achieving high levels of output.

* There are two main types of operational strategies: low cost and differentiation. Low-cost strategies focus on reducing costs and offering products at lower prices. Differentiation strategies aim to offer unique or premium products that are non-comparable with their competitors.

* Another important aspect of Operations Strategy is capacity planning. This is the process of determining the capacity needed to meet demand and making sure that the capacity is available when needed. 

* Supply chain management is also a part of Operations Strategy. This involves coordinating the flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers. Supply chain management seeks to reduce costs, reduce lead times, and improve service levels.

Operations strategy helps an organization in the following ways:

* Increase efficiency and productivity
* Reduce operating expenses
* Improve quality, speed and dependability of the operations
* Enhance customer service
* Identify new market opportunities
* Increase competitiveness 

Overall, the aim of Operations Strategy is to create value through the efficient use of resources, while meeting customer satisfaction and organizational goals.
