# Leadership

Leadership is being the boss of a group of people. It means you are responsible for guiding them towards a goal, just like a captain leads a team to victory on a sports field.

Leadership involves: 

- Setting a clear goal or vision for the group 
- Motivating and inspiring others to work towards the goal 
- Making decisions for the group based on the vision 
- Communicating well with the group to keep everyone informed 
- Being responsible for the success or failure of the group 

Good leaders show:
 
- Confidence 
- Trustworthiness 
- Respect for others 
- Strong communication skills 
- A willingness to listen to others 
- A positive attitude 

Anyone can be a leader, from parents to coaches to business owners. It's all about being responsible and guiding others towards success.
