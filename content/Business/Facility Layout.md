# Facility Layout

Facility layout means deciding on the best physical arrangement of people, machines, and workflows within any given workspace. Here is a simple explanation for someone very young to understand: 

* Imagine you're trying to build a house, but you have to decide where to put each room and how to connect them to each other.
* You need to decide where the kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom will be and how you'll move from one room to another.
* Similarly, Facility Layout means deciding where different items (like machinery, workstations, and raw materials) will be placed and how people and things will move from one point to another.
* Having a well-designed Facility Layout will help people to work quickly, efficiently, and safely.
* For example, imagine you're working in a factory with a poor layout that makes it difficult to move raw materials from one production stage to another. 
* A good Facility Layout can help optimize the space, reduce traffic, increase safety, and speed up work.
