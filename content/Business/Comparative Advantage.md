# Comparative Advantage

Comparative advantage is when one person or country is better at making a certain thing than another person or country. Say you and your friend are playing a game and you're both good at building blocks but your friend is better at making towers. Your friend making towers is his comparative advantage.

Similarly, different countries have different resources, skills and technology. They also have different opportunities for working and production. This means that one country may be more efficient than another in producing a good. This leads to a country having a comparative advantage in producing that good compared to other countries.

Here are some key points to summarize this: 

* Comparative advantage is about being better or more efficient than someone else in doing something.
* It means that one person, firm, or country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another.
* This theory helps explain why countries trade with each other.
* By focusing on their respective comparative advantages, countries can specialize in certain goods and services they are good at producing, and then trade with other countries for goods and services they are not as efficient at producing.
