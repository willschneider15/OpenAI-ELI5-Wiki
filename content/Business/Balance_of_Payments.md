# Balance of Payments

Balance of Payments is a tool used to measure how much money is going in and out of a country. It basically looks at all the transactions a country has with the rest of the world. Here are some important things to know:

- Transactions include buying and selling goods and services, investments, and money sent or received from abroad.
- If a country is exporting more than it imports, it has a surplus in its balance of payments. This means it is making more money than it is spending and can be a good thing for the economy.
- If a country is importing more than it is exporting, it has a deficit in its balance of payments. This means it is spending more money than it is making and can be a bad thing for the economy.
- The balance of payments is divided into two main accounts: the current account and the capital account.
- The current account includes transactions involving goods and services, while the capital account deals with movements of capital, like investments.
- A balance of payments crisis can occur if a country runs out of foreign currency to pay for imports or if investors lose confidence in the country's ability to pay its debts.
