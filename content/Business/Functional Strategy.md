# Functional Strategy

**Functional Strategy** is like setting up a plan for each team or department in a business to help achieve the overall goals of the company. It focuses on the specific actions and decisions that each team can take to contribute to the success of the business. For example:

* The Marketing team might focus on creating targeted ads or social media campaigns to increase sales.
* The Operations team might focus on optimizing production to increase efficiency.
* The HR team might focus on hiring and retaining talented employees to build a strong team.

Some key things to know about Functional Strategy include:

* Each team's strategy should align with the overall goals of the company.
* Functional strategies can be adjusted over time to adapt to changes in the market or business environment.
* Communication and collaboration between teams is important to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals. 

By having a clear Functional Strategy in place, businesses can work more efficiently towards achieving their objectives.
