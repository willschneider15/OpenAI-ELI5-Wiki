# Cost Structures

A company spends money to make its products or provide its services, and cost structure is the way in which those costs are divided up. In other words, it is how much it costs for a company to make its products or services. Cost structure can be divided into two types: fixed and variable.

* Fixed Costs: Costs that remain the same regardless of the volume of production are fixed costs. These costs are constant and don't change. Rent, salaries, and utility bills are a few examples of fixed costs.

* Variable Costs: Costs that change based on the volume of production are known as variable costs. These costs increase or decrease as the company produces more or fewer products or services. Raw materials, production supplies, and transportation costs are examples of variable costs.

Cost structure influences profit margins, break-even points, and other financial metrics. A low-cost structure means a company can offer products or services at a cheaper rate, which can be a competitive advantage. A high-cost structure, on the other hand, can result in higher prices or a lower profit margin.
