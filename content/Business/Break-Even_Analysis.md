# Break-Even Analysis

Break-Even Analysis is a way for businesses to figure out when they are going to start making profits.

**Here is a simple explanation:**

- Imagine that you are selling lemonade.
- You bought all the ingredients for $10.
- You sell each cup of lemonade for $1.
- You need to sell enough lemonade cups to get back the $10 you spent on the ingredients. 
- After you sell 10 cups of lemonade (10x$1=$10), you have just reached your break-even point.
- Now, every cup of lemonade you sell after that will be pure profit.

**In a nutshell:**

- Break-Even Analysis is a tool that helps businesses know when they will start making profits.
- It calculates how much a company needs to sell to cover its fixed and variable costs.
- Once a company hits the break-even point, it will start making a profit.
- Knowing the break-even point can help companies set prices, make production decisions, and determine if they are looking for investment or loans.
