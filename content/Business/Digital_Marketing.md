# Digital Marketing

Digital Marketing is using the internet to help businesses promote their products or services. 

Here are some ways it works: 

* Companies use social media (like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) to connect with potential customers and share information.
* They also use email to persuade people to buy by sharing deals, new products, and other updates.
* Businesses promote their products by creating websites that explain what they sell and why people should buy their products.
* They can also use online ads that appear on websites or in search results. These ads lead people to their website or social media page. 
* Digital Marketing can also involve creating content such as blogs or videos that provide valuable information to consumers. 

In summary, Digital Marketing is a way for businesses to promote themselves online through social media, email, websites, ads, and content.
