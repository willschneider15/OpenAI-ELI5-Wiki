- *Training and development*: A sales manager is responsible for training and developing the sales team. This enables the team to be successful in their roles and meet targets.
- *Creating plans*: Sales management involves creating plans to achieve targets. These plans make it easier for the sales team to know exactly what they need to do to achieve success.
- *Monitoring sales*: Sales management requires constant monitoring of sales and sales processes. This helps identify areas where improvements need to be made, and opportunities to increase sales and revenue.
- *Motivating the team*: Motivating the team is an essential part of sales management. Giving rewards and incentives to employees who achieve targets can help build motivation and drive success.
