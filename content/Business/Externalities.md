# Externalities

Externalities happen when one person's action affects another person without market compensation. This means that the consequences of one person's actions can be either positive or negative for other people. It is like when someone cooks in the kitchen and the smell spreads throughout the house or when a driver honks the car on the street and disturbs people's peace. Externalities can be divided into two types:

- Positive externalities happen when an action benefits someone else. For example, when a person plants trees in their yard, it provides oxygen and contributes to a cleaner environment that everyone can enjoy.
- Negative externalities happen when an action harms someone else. For instance, when factories release pollutants into the air and water, it causes health problems for people and harms the environment.

Externalities can affect market efficiency and lead to market failures. This is because the costs or benefits of externalities are not captured in market prices. To prevent externalities, governments may need to intervene and implement policies such as taxes, subsidies, and regulations.
