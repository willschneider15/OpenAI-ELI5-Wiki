# Motivation Theories

Motivation theories are a way to understand why people do what they do. Here are some key ideas:

* **Intrinsic motivation** comes from within a person, like a desire to do something for its own sake.

* **Extrinsic motivation** comes from outside a person, like a reward or punishment.

* **Maslow's hierarchy of needs** says that people have different needs, and they need to satisfy lower needs before they can move on to higher needs.

* **Herzberg's two-factor theory** says that there are certain factors that lead to job satisfaction (like opportunities for growth) and other factors that lead to dissatisfaction (like unfair pay).

* **Expectancy theory** says that people will be motivated if they believe that a) they can do the task, b) the task is worth doing, and c) they will get a reward if they do it well.

* **Goal-setting theory** says that people will be motivated if they have clear goals that are specific, challenging and achievable.

Overall, motivation theories help us understand what drives people, and how we can use that knowledge to create better workplaces and improve performance.
