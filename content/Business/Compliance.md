# Compliance

Compliance means following the rules that are made.

* It's like playing a game with rules, where everyone has to obey them to play the game.
* In business, there are rules made by the government and also by the company to make sure it is working properly.
* Following these rules is very important to avoid penalties, fines, and legal action from authorities.
* Ignoring the rules can harm the business reputation and can result in the loss of customer trust.
* Compliance can help businesses to maintain a healthy and safe environment for employees, customers, and the public.
* It can also help businesses to retain their license, certification, and registration required to operate legally.
* Businesses can ensure compliance by creating a compliance program, training employees on compliance policies and procedures, and regularly monitoring and reporting the compliance status.
