# Accounting

Accounting is a way of keeping track of all the money people or companies earn and spend.

Accounting helps us to:

* Record and organize financial transactions
* Keep track of money coming in and going out
* Make budgets and financial plans
* Check if a business is making money or not

Think of accounting like a checklist that helps you keep track of everything you buy and sell. Just like a grocery list, you write down what you bought and how much it costs. This helps you know how much money you have left and what you can afford to buy next time.

Companies use accounting for the same reasons. It helps organize their finances, track their income and expenses, make smart financial decisions, and keep their business running smoothly.

Imagine running a lemonade stand. You would use accounting to keep track of how much money you made from selling lemonade, how much you spent on lemons and sugar, and how much profit you made. This information can help you decide whether it's worth it to keep selling lemonade or try something different.
