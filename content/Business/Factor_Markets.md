# Factor Markets

Factor markets are where factors of production are bought and sold. Factors of production are the things that people use to produce goods and services. These are the resources that businesses need in order to operate. They are divided into four categories:

* Land: Resources that come from nature such as timber, water, or minerals.
* Labor: The work that people do in order to produce goods or services.
* Capital: The tools, equipment, and machines that are used to produce goods or services.
* Entrepreneurship: The creativity, innovation, and risk-taking skills of people who start businesses.

In factor markets, businesses buy and rent these resources from individuals and other businesses. The prices of these resources are determined by supply and demand. For example, if there is a high demand for a certain type of labor, the price of that labor will go up. 

Factor markets are important because they help businesses to operate efficiently. When businesses can buy or rent the resources they need at a reasonable price, they can produce goods or services more efficiently.
