# Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

### Gross Domestic Product

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure to understand a country's economy at a certain point in time. GDP represents the total amount of goods and services produced in a country during a specific period, usually a year.

* GDP is like counting how many apples were grown in an orchard during a year, but instead it counts everything a country produces.
* The goods and services that are included in GDP are things like cars, clothes, food, and haircuts.
* It's important because it tells us how strong or weak a country's economy is at a given time.
* A high GDP means that a country is making a lot of goods and services and people are buying them.
* A low GDP means that a country is not making many goods and services and people are not buying them.
* GDP includes everything produced within the country, even if the company that produces them is owned by people from other countries.

GDP is calculated using the following equation:

GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports)
