# Financial Derivatives

Financial Derivatives are like the toppings we add to a pizza. If a plain cheese pizza is a stock or bond, then derivatives are like the pepperoni, mushrooms or olives that we add to make it more tasty. 

* Financial derivatives are a type of investment that derive their value from an underlying asset such as a stock, bond or commodity. 
* They are called derivatives because the value of the investment is derived from their underlying asset. 
* With derivatives, investors can make bets on whether the price of an underlying asset will rise or fall. 
* The most common types of derivatives are futures contracts, options contracts and swaps. 
* Derivatives can be useful to investors because they can help to manage risk or increase profits. 
* However, they can also be risky and complex, and may not be suitable for all investors.

So, just like pizza toppings, financial derivatives can make an investment more interesting and potentially more rewarding, but they can also come with risks that need to be considered before investing.
