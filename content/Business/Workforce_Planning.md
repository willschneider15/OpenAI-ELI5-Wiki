# Workforce Planning

**Workforce planning** is a process of determining the future goals of a business and managing the people resources to achieve those goals. This means that a company thinks about what new projects and plans they will need to complete and make sure they have the right amount of people with the right skills to do the work in the future.

Here are some key points about workforce planning:

* It helps businesses to identify what skills and knowledge their employees can bring to the company and what skills will be required in the future
* It ensures that the company has the talent they need, without shortages or surpluses, to achieve their goals
* It involves analyzing the current workforce, forecasting future workforce needs, and developing strategies to meet those needs
* It can help businesses identify gaps in current employeesâ€™ skills, knowledge and experiences so that they can be addressed through training or recruitment
* It also helps businesses to measure the performance of their employees and the effectiveness of their recruitment and training strategies. 

In conclusion, workforce planning helps a business to get the right number and quality of workers needed to achieve their future goals.
