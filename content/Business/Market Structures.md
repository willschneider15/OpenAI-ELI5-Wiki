# Market Structures

A market structure is the way companies compete with each other when selling their products. There are four types of market structures:

1. Perfect Competition: This means that there are a lot of companies selling the exact same product, and buyers can buy from any of them at the same price.

2. Monopolistic Competition: This means that there are a lot of companies selling similar products, but they might have slightly different features, and each company might have a different price.

3. Oligopoly: This means that there are only a few companies selling a product, and they have a lot of control over the price of that product.

4. Monopoly: This means that there is only one company selling a product, so they have complete control over the price.

Some important features of a market structure are entry barriers, which can prevent new companies from entering the market, and product differentiation, which means that a company's product has unique features that makes it different from competitors' products. Market structures can affect how much profit a company can make, how much they can charge for their product, and how competitive the market is.
