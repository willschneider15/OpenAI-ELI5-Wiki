# Gantt Charts

A Gantt Chart is a type of visual representation that helps people understand when tasks need to be completed and when they overlap with one another. It is named after its inventor, Henry Gantt in 1910.

* Gantt Charts use horizontal bars to display the start and end dates of each task.
* Each task is listed on the left-hand side of the chart, while the timeline is displayed across the top.
* The length of each bar represents the duration of the task.
* Gantt Charts help in monitoring the progress of a project and can be used to identify dependencies and potential delays in scheduling
* They are useful to see which tasks can be completed concurrently, and which ones need to be finished before starting other ones.

In short, Gantt Charts help us plan and keep track of all the work we need to do, in a way that's easy to understand.
