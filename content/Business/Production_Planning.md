# Production Planning

Production planning is like making a plan for a big project! When a company wants to make a product, they need to plan how they will create it.

* Think about baking a cake - you need a recipe and a plan for when to mix the ingredients, when to put them in the oven, and when to take the cake out. 
* For production planning in business, you need to figure out what resources you need (like materials, machines, and workers) and when each of those resources will be available.
* This planning process helps make sure the company can make the product on time and with the right quality.
* It also helps the company figure out how many products they can make in a certain amount of time and how much it might cost.
* To make a good production plan, businesses need to take into account things like demand for the product, the company's budget, and the production process.
