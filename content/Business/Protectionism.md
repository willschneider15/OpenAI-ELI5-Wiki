# Protectionism

Protectionism is the idea of trying to protect your own country's goods and services from foreign competition. It is like you wanting to be the only kid playing with a certain toy, and not letting any other kid play even though they might want to. Here are some things to keep in mind about protectionism:

- The government will often set up barriers to make it harder for foreign goods and services to enter the country, such as taxes or quotas.
- This can help local industries because they will have less competition which means less risks of going out of business.
- However, protectionism can also cause problems such as limited access to foreign goods which may also limit consumer choices, lack of innovation due to lack of competition, and ultimately higher prices for consumers because they will only have limited options to choose from.
- Protectionism is a controversial topic and there are different opinions on whether it is a good or bad thing.
