# Strategic Planning

Strategic planning is a way to help us make important decisions about what we want to accomplish and how we will get there. 

Think about it like planning for a big trip:

* First, we decide on where we want to go (our goal or objective).
* Next, we figure out how we will get there (our strategy or plan).
* Along the way, we make adjustments if things change or if we encounter roadblocks (monitoring and evaluation).

Here are some key elements of strategic planning:

* **Mission statement** - a clear and concise statement of why we exist and what we hope to achieve.
* **Vision statement** - a statement of what we want our future to look like.
* **SWOT analysis** - an assessment of our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
* **Goals and objectives** - these are specific, measurable targets that help us work towards our mission and vision.
* **Action plan** - a plan that outlines the tasks, resources, and timeline needed to achieve our goals.
* **Monitoring and evaluation** - ongoing attention to how well our plan is working, and making adjustments as needed.

By taking time to plan strategically, we can work more effectively towards our goals and stay on track even when things get challenging.
