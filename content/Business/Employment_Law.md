# Employment Law

Employment Law is a set of rules that make sure employers and employees are treating each other fairly at work. 

Some important concepts of Employment Law include:

- Minimum Wage: Everyone who has a job must be paid at least a certain amount of money per hour, depending on their job and where they work. 

- Overtime: When an employee works more than a certain number of hours per week, they must be paid extra money for each additional hour they work. 

- Discrimination: Employers cannot treat employees unfairly because of their race, gender, religion, age, or disability. This means that everyone should have equal opportunities at work. 

- Safety: Employers must make sure that the workplace is safe for employees to do their jobs. 

- Harassment: Employees should not be bullied, intimidated, or made to feel uncomfortable at work. This includes sexual harassment, which is when someone is treated inappropriately because of their gender. 

Remember, Employment Law is there to protect both employees and employers. It helps make sure that work is a fair and safe place for everyone.
