# Public Relations

Public relations (PR) is the way businesses communicate with the public to gain good reputation and promote a positive image of the organization. Public relations are the actions businesses take to:

- Inform the public about their products, services, and accomplishments.
- Build positive relationships with the public and the media.
- Address the concerns and doubts of the public or their consumers.

Public relations differs from advertising because advertising is paid promotion, while public relations depend on creating influence and trust with the public by:

- Reaching out to the media and generating news stories.
- Organizing events and contests to engage the public.
- Responding to queries and complaints from the public.
- Creating and publishing engaging content on social media platforms.

In conclusion, Public Relations is the way a business builds trust and creates a positive image with the public, media, and consumers through actions that don't involve direct sales pitches.
