# Retention

Retention is the idea of keeping something or someone for a long time. In business, this usually refers to keeping customers or employees. Think about it this way:

* Imagine you have a favorite toy that you love to play with. You don't want to lose it or replace it with something else because it makes you happy.
* In a store, the owners want you to keep coming back to buy things. To make sure you do, they may offer you rewards, discounts, or nice customer service so you feel appreciated.
* For a company, the employees are the people who do the work. If the company doesn't treat their employees well or pay them enough, the employees might quit and go work somewhere else. This is why companies often offer benefits, incentives, and a good working culture to keep their employees happy and loyal.

Retention is important because it helps businesses create stability and maintain their success over time.
