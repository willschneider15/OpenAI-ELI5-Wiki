# Turnover

Turnover is the amount of money a company makes in a specific period of time, usually a year. 

It's like counting how much money you've made from selling lemonade on your lemonade stand in one summer. 

Here are some key points to keep in mind: 

- Turnover is important because it helps us understand how well a business is doing financially.
- The more money a business makes, the higher its turnover.
- Turnover is calculated by adding up all the money a business gets from selling products or services.
- Turnover is different from profit. Profit is the money a business makes after all its expenses are subtracted.
- To increase turnover, a business can try to sell more products or services, raise prices or find new customers.
- It's also important to note that high turnover doesn't always mean a business is doing well financially. If a business is spending more money than it's making, it can have a high turnover but still lose money. 

In summary, turnover is the total amount of money a business makes from selling its products or services in a given period of time.
