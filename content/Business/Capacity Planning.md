# Capacity Planning

**Capacity planning** is when businesses plan how much they should produce. 

* It's like when you're planning a birthday party and you need to make sure there's enough cake for everyone. 
* Businesses use capacity planning to make sure they produce enough products or services to meet customer demand. 
* If they don't produce enough, customers might go somewhere else to get what they need. 
* If they produce too much, they might have extra inventory that they can't sell, which is a waste of money. 
* Capacity planning helps businesses balance the cost of producing enough products with the cost of producing too much. 
* It also helps businesses plan for the future by looking at trends to predict customer demand. 

In summary, capacity planning is like making sure there's enough cake for the party, but for businesses it's making sure they produce enough products for customers without wasting money.
