# Resource Allocation

Resource allocation means deciding how to use your stuff wisely. 

* When you have too much homework and too little time, you need to decide which tasks to do first and which tasks to put off until later.
* Similarly, when a business has limited resources (like money, people, equipment), it needs to decide how to use them to achieve its goals.
* Resource allocation involves prioritizing how to use these resources to maximize their effectiveness.
* This might involve investing more money in a project that will bring in more revenue, hiring more employees to complete a project faster, or upgrading equipment to increase efficiency.
* The goal of resource allocation is to make the most of what you have, so you can get the most done with the least amount of waste.
