# Strategic Alliances

A **strategic alliance** is like when you and your best friend work together on a school project, but for businesses. 

- It's when two or more companies agree to work together towards a common goal
- This is usually done to increase profits, reduce risk, or gain access to new technology or markets
- Strategic alliances can vary in size, from small joint ventures to large-scale mergers
- The partnering companies remain separate, but they work together in specific areas where they have strengths or complementary skills
- For example, a clothing company might form a strategic alliance with a fabric supplier to ensure consistent quality materials for their products
- Another example is when a technology company partners with a manufacturer to create a new product that combines their expertise and capabilities
- Strategic alliances can provide a competitive advantage by sharing resources, knowledge, and expertise
- They can also help companies enter new markets, reach new customers or expand their offerings

Overall, strategic alliances are beneficial partnerships for companies seeking to enhance their operations while minimizing risks and costs.
