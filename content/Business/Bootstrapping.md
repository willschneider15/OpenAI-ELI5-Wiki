# Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a way of starting a business without borrowing money from people or banks. It means starting a business with little to no money and using the resources you already have to grow your business.

* To bootstrap means to start and grow your business without external help.
* You use your own money and resources to build your business.
* It is like building a sandcastle without any extra sand or tools, you have to use only what you have.
* You have to work hard and be creative with what you have to make your business successful.
* It is a good way to start a business if you don't have the financial resources to get help from outside investors or banks.
* Successful companies like Apple, HP and Microsoft all started as bootstrapped companies. 

Bootstrap businesses can still be very successful and can grow into large companies if they are managed well.
