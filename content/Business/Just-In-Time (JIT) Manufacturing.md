# Just-In-Time (JIT) Manufacturing

Just-In-Time (JIT) Manufacturing is a process that helps companies save money by only making what they need, when they need it, and in the exact amount they need. JIT production is like making a sandwich just in time for lunch: you only need the bread, meat, and vegetables necessary to make one sandwich, so you take exactly that from the fridge, assemble the sandwich, and enjoy it without wasting any food.

In JIT manufacturing, companies buy and receive raw materials only when they get an order from customers or when the inventory is running low. Then, they start manufacturing the finished product by using these raw materials, and shipping the final goods immediately after they are made. JIT also involves reducing waste, defects, and variation in the production process so that companies can cut down on costs and improve efficiency.

Here are some important points to remember about JIT manufacturing:

- It is a lean manufacturing system that focuses on producing only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the quantity demanded by customers.
- It helps companies to reduce inventory costs, space requirements, and waste, while increasing flexibility and responsiveness to changes in demand.
- It requires a high degree of coordination and collaboration among different departments, suppliers, and customers.
- It can be challenging to implement and maintain, as it relies heavily on reliable suppliers, accurate forecasting, and comprehensive quality control.
