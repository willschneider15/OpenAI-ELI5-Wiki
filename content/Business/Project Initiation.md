# Project Initiation

Project initiation is like setting up your toys to play a new game! 

* It's the first step you take before starting any project.
* Just like setting up your toys, you need to gather all the information you need.
* Then, you need to decide on the goal of the project.
* You also need to figure out how to achieve that goal and what steps you need to take to make the project a success.
* This is where you create a plan or a blueprint to guide you throughout the journey.
* You need to identify your resources, such as people and technology, before you start the project.
* Finally, you need to be able to explain the project to all the people who will be involved in it. 

By taking the time to initiate a project properly, you can ensure that everything is organized and planned from the beginning, so you don't encounter any surprises later on!
