# Income Statement

An **Income Statement** shows how much money a business made and spent during a certain time, like a month or a year. It subtracts expenses from the revenue to find out how much profit or loss a company had. It is important to look at this statement to understand how well a business is doing or what changes need to be made.

In simpler terms, it is a report card for a business that tells us how much money it made and how much money it spent.
