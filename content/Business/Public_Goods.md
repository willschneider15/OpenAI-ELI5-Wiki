# Public Goods

Public goods are goods that are available for everyone to use and enjoy, without the need for anyone to pay for them. They are not like private goods, which people have to pay for, and which can usually only be used by the person who paid for them.

Some examples of public goods include:

- Parks and public spaces, which are available for everyone to use without any charge
- Clean air and water, which are essential for everyone's health and well-being
- National defense, which protects the country as a whole, not just individual people or businesses
- Scientific research, which creates new knowledge that can benefit everyone

Because public goods are available to everyone, they are often paid for by the government, using tax dollars. This can be controversial, because some people do not want to pay for goods that they may not use or benefit from themselves.

Overall, public goods are important because they help to ensure that everyone has access to the resources and services they need to live healthy and happy lives.
