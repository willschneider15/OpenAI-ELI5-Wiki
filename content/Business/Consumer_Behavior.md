# Consumer Behavior

Consumer behavior is how people act when they want to buy something.

Here are some things to remember about consumer behavior:

- It's about why people buy things and what influences them.
- People have needs and wants that drive their buying decisions.
- Some things that influence people's buying decisions include their friends, the media, and branding.
- People also think about things like price and quality when they're thinking about buying something.
- Sometimes people buy things just because they want them, even if they don't necessarily need them.

Overall, consumer behavior is about understanding why people buy things and how companies can use that information to sell more products.
