Internal controls help businesses make sure that everything runs the way it should. It's like a set of rules to help people stay organized and prevent mistakes or problems. Think of it like having a safety net to catch things before they get too big. Here are some things that internal controls can help with:

- Keeping track of money and making sure it's all accounted for

- Checking for mistakes and fixing them
- Preventing fraud or theft by making sure everyone knows what's expected of them

Basically, internal controls are like a set of checks and balances to help businesses stay on track and avoid problems. It's an important part of running a successful company and making sure everyone is working together smoothly.
