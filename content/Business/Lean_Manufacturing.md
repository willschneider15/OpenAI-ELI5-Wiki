# Lean Manufacturing

Lean Manufacturing is a way of making things that is focused on cutting out waste, increasing efficiency, and lowering costs. It is called "Lean" because it aims to eliminate unnecessary steps in the production process and streamline operations to maximize value and minimize waste.

Some key principles of Lean Manufacturing are:
- Continuous improvement: always looking for ways to improve and make the process better
- Just-in-time inventory: only having as much inventory as is needed to fulfill orders
- Pull production: producing only based on customer demand, rather than producing excess product that may not be needed
- Kaizen: a philosophy of continuous improvement, involving all employees in the process

By implementing Lean Manufacturing techniques, companies can improve quality, increase productivity, and reduce lead times. This can lead to higher profits and a competitive advantage in the market.
