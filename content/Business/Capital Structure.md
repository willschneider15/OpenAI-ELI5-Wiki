# Capital Structure

Capital Structure refers to the way a company finances its operations and growth by combining different types of financing sources. It includes all the different funding sources including debt, equity, and other securities that a corporation uses to raise money.

* Think of it like a house, a company needs a strong foundation to build upon.
* The foundation of a company's financial structure is its capital structure.
* Companies typically use a combination of equity financing (issuing stock) and debt financing (borrowing money) to fund their operations.
* Each type of financing comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.
* Equity financing usually means giving up ownership in the company, but it also means the company doesn't have to make regular interest payments.
* Debt financing involves borrowing money from lenders, but the company must make regular interest payments and repay the principal.
* By finding the right balance between debt and equity financing, a company can achieve an optimal capital structure that maximizes its growth potential while minimizing risk.
