# Risk and Return

Risk and Return are two important factors that are considered by investors when they want to invest their money in any business. 

* Risk means the chance that their investments will lose value or they will lose money. 
* Return means the money that they will get back after investing their money in that business. 

In other words, Risk refers to the possibility of losing money, while Return refers to the possibility of making money. 

* The relationship between Risk and Return is very important. 
* The higher the risk, the higher the potential return. 
* However, if they take too much risk, they might lose all of their investment. 
* If they take too little risk, the return on their investment may not be enough to meet their investment goals. 

Therefore, it's important to balance the risk and return when investing. Investors need to understand the risks associated with any investment and ensure that the potential return is worth it.
