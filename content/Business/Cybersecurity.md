# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is like a superhero that keeps our digital stuff safe from bad guys that want to steal or harm it. Just like how we lock our doors to keep our toys safe, we need to lock our computers and phones to keep our information safe. 

Here are some important things to remember about cybersecurity:

- **Passwords** are like secret codes that only we know. We need to make sure they are strong and not easy for bad guys to guess.
- **Phishing** is when bad guys pretend to be someone else and try to trick us into giving them our information. We need to be careful about clicking on links or giving out personal information online.
- **Anti-virus software** is like a shield that protects our devices from viruses and other bad stuff. We need to make sure we have it installed and updated.
- **Public Wi-Fi** is like a playground that anyone can go to. We need to be careful about using it to do important things like banking or shopping.
- **Backups** are like extra copies of our important stuff. We need to make sure we have backups so we don't lose everything if something bad happens.

By being smart and staying safe online, we can make sure our digital stuff stays protected!
