# Credit Management

**Credit management** refers to the practices that businesses use to manage the credit given to their customers. It involves ensuring that customers pay their debts on time and collecting debts that remain unpaid.

Here are some key concepts in credit management, explained in simple terms:

* **Creditworthiness**: This refers to a customer's ability to pay back debt. When a business is deciding whether to grant credit to a customer, they will consider the customer's credit score and financial history.
* **Credit Limits**: This is the maximum amount of credit that a customer is allowed to have with a business. The business will set this limit based on the customer's creditworthiness and other factors.
* **Payment Terms**: This refers to the period of time in which a customer is expected to pay their debt. For example, a business might have payment terms of 30 days, meaning that the customer has 30 days to pay their debt before it is considered overdue.
* **Debt Collection**: This is the process of collecting unpaid debts. If a customer fails to pay their debt on time, the business might send them reminders and then escalate the matter to a debt collection agency if the debt remains unpaid.

Overall, credit management is important for businesses to ensure that they are paid for the products or services they provide and to avoid financial difficulties caused by unpaid debts.
