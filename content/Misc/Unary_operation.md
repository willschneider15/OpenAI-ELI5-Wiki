# Unary operation

Unary operations are operations that only involve a single value or variable. This means that the operation only requires one operand (the value or variable) to perform the operation. Unary operations are often used in mathematics and programming to perform basic calculations or to modify the value of a variable. Examples of unary operations include incrementing or decrementing a value, negating a value, and taking the absolute value of a number. Unary operations are also commonly used in computer science to manipulate data in a specific way. For example, a unary operator can be used to convert a value from one type to another, or to perform an operation on a variable. Unary operations are often used in combination with other operations to create more complex calculations and operations.
