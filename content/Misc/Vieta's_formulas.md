# Vieta's formulas

Vieta's formulas are a set of equations used to find the roots of a polynomial equation. They are named after the French mathematician Francois Vieta, who developed them in the 16th century.

Vieta's formulas allow us to find the roots of a polynomial equation without having to solve it directly. To use the formulas, we take the coefficients of the polynomial equation and plug them into the formulas. The formulas will then give us the roots of the equation.

Vieta's formulas are useful because they allow us to quickly find the roots of a polynomial equation without having to solve it directly. This makes them a useful tool for solving equations quickly and efficiently.
