# Reduction (mathematics)

Reduction is a concept in mathematics that means taking something complex and breaking it down into simpler parts. It is often used to solve problems, such as equations or even whole systems of equations.

For example, if you have a system of equations with multiple variables, you can use reduction to break down the system into smaller parts. This can help you find the solution to the system.

Reduction is also used to simplify equations. By breaking down the equation into smaller parts, it can be easier to solve.

Reduction is a powerful tool in mathematics and can be used to solve complex problems. It is important to understand the concept of reduction and how it can be used to help solve problems.
