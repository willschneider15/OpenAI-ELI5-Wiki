# De Morgan algebra

De Morgan's Algebra is a set of mathematical rules that allow us to change the way that we express logical statements. It is named after Augustus De Morgan, who first proposed it in 1847. 

The two main rules of De Morgan's Algebra are: 
1. The negation of a conjunction (two things joined together) is the disjunction (two things being separate) of the negations.
2. The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.

These two rules allow us to change the way we express a logical statement, for example, if we have the statement "it is not raining and it is not sunny", we can use De Morgan's Algebra to change it to "it is not raining or it is not sunny". 

In short, De Morgan's Algebra allows us to change the way we express logical statements, making them easier to understand and work with.
