# List of vector calculus identities

Vector calculus identities are mathematical equations that express relationships between vectors and scalars. These identities are used to simplify and solve problems involving vector fields, which are collections of vectors that represent physical phenomena such as electric and magnetic fields. Vector calculus identities allow us to calculate the derivatives of vector fields, which can be used to study the behavior of the fields. Additionally, these identities can be used to calculate the divergence, curl, and gradient of vector fields, which are used to understand the behavior of the fields in space. Vector calculus identities are an important tool in physics, engineering, and mathematics.
