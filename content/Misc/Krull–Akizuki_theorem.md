# Krull–Akizuki theorem

Krull–Akizuki theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that if a number is divisible by a prime number, then that number is also divisible by any power of that prime number. 

For example, if a number is divisible by 3, then it is also divisible by 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, and so on. This theorem is useful in finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers. The GCD is the largest number that can evenly divide the numbers. 

Krull–Akizuki theorem makes finding the GCD easier by allowing us to check for divisibility by prime numbers instead of all possible numbers. This theorem can also be used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers, which is the smallest number that is divisible by all of them.
