# Distributive homomorphism

Distributive homomorphism is a mathematical concept that states that a certain operation performed on two elements of a set can be distributed over the set. For example, if you have a set of numbers and you want to add two of them together, you can distribute the addition operation over the set, so that instead of adding the two numbers together, you can add each individual number to each element in the set. This concept is useful in mathematics because it allows for more efficient calculations and can be used to solve various problems.
