# Chebyshev polynomials

Chebyshev polynomials are a family of mathematical functions that are used to approximate other functions. They are named after Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev and are widely used in approximation theory, numerical analysis, and signal processing. Chebyshev polynomials are defined by a recurrence relation which allows them to be easily computed. They are characterized by their fast convergence to the target function, meaning they can quickly approximate a function with a high degree of accuracy. Chebyshev polynomials are also useful in solving differential equations, as they can be used to construct solutions to the equations.
