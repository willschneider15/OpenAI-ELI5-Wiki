# Otto Hesse

Otto Hesse was a German mathematician who lived from 1811 to 1874. He is best known for his work on graph theory and for his contributions to the field of topology. He is credited with inventing the concept of a "graph," which is a diagram that shows how points are connected. He also developed a way to represent graphs using a series of lines and curves.

Hesse's work was a major contribution to mathematics and has been used in many areas, including computer science. His ideas have helped us understand networks, which are systems of connected points. He also developed a way to measure the distance between two points, known as the Hesse Distance.

Hesse's work is still studied and used today, and his contributions have helped shape the way we understand and use mathematics.
