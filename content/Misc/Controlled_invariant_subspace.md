# Controlled invariant subspace

A controlled invariant subspace is a space within a larger system that is not affected by outside forces. It is a space where the internal dynamics of the system are stable and remain the same over time. This stability allows the system to be used for control and prediction. For example, a robot arm can be controlled by setting up a controlled invariant subspace that allows the robot to move in a certain way without being affected by external forces. This helps the robot move in a predictable way and can be used to control the robot's movements.
