# Brahmagupta's identity

Brahmagupta's identity is an equation used in mathematics to calculate the sum of two squares. It states that for any two numbers, a and b, the sum of the squares of a and b is equal to the square of their sum, plus twice the product of a and b. This equation can be written mathematically as: a² + b² = (a + b)² + 2ab.

This equation is useful in a variety of mathematical calculations, such as finding the area of a rectangle or the length of a diagonal of a square. It can also be used to determine the sum of two numbers when their squares are known.

Brahmagupta's identity is an important part of mathematics and is used in many different fields. It is a useful tool for solving a variety of mathematical problems and is a great way to understand the relationship between numbers.
