# Standard basis

Standard basis is a set of vectors that form a basis for a vector space. These vectors are usually orthogonal and are used to represent any vector in the vector space. The standard basis is used to help simplify calculations and make them easier to understand. For example, if you have a 3-dimensional vector space, the standard basis would consist of three vectors that are perpendicular to each other. Each vector would represent a different dimension in the vector space. By using the standard basis, you can easily calculate the coordinates of any vector in the vector space. This makes it much easier to perform operations such as addition and subtraction. Additionally, the standard basis allows you to convert a vector from one coordinate system to another. This can be useful when dealing with complex vector spaces.
