# Linear form

Linear form is a type of mathematical expression that consists of two or more terms that are related by a linear operator. It is a way of representing a relationship between two or more variables. 

Linear form is a type of equation that can be written in the form of `ax + b = 0` where `a` and `b` are constants and `x` is the variable. This equation is referred to as the standard form of a linear equation. 

In linear form, the coefficients of the variables must be constants and the terms must be in the same order. The coefficients of the variables can be positive or negative, and the terms must have the same degree. 

Linear form can be used to represent a variety of relationships between two or more variables. For example, it can be used to represent the relationship between the price of a product and the number of units sold. It can also be used to represent the relationship between the speed of a car and the distance it travels. 

In short, linear form is a mathematical expression that consists of two or more terms that are related by a linear operator. It is a way of representing a relationship between two or more variables.
