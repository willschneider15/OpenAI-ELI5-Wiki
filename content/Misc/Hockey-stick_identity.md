# Hockey-stick identity

Hockey-stick identity is a mathematical concept that describes the growth of a number over time. It is represented by a graph with a steep upward slope that resembles the shape of a hockey stick. This graph shows that the number increases rapidly at first and then levels off.

The concept of a hockey-stick identity is often used to describe the growth of a population or the growth of a company's profits over time. In population growth, the hockey-stick identity shows that a population increases quickly at first, and then levels off as the population reaches its maximum capacity. In company profits, the hockey-stick identity shows that profits increase quickly at first, and then level off as the company reaches its maximum profitability.

In both cases, the hockey-stick identity shows how the growth of a number can start off slow and then quickly increase before leveling off again. This concept can be used to understand how populations, companies, and other entities grow over time.
