# Spectral clustering

Spectral clustering is a way of grouping data points into clusters. It works by looking at the relationship between the data points and then using that information to divide them into groups. It does this by using a mathematical technique called the eigenvector decomposition, which looks for patterns in the data. The data points are then assigned to clusters based on the patterns found. Spectral clustering is useful for finding clusters in complex data sets. It can also be used to identify outliers, or data points that don't fit in any of the clusters.
