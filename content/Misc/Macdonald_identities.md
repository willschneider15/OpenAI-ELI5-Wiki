# Macdonald identities

Macdonald identities are a type of algebraic identities that are used to simplify and manipulate polynomial expressions. They are named after the mathematician John Macdonald, who discovered them in the late 19th century. 

Macdonald identities are two equations that are related by a substitution of a variable. The two equations are usually a polynomial equation and a rational equation. The polynomial equation is usually a sum of terms with different powers of a variable, while the rational equation is a fraction with a numerator and denominator that are polynomials. 

The substitution of the variable in the two equations creates a relation between the coefficients of the polynomials. By solving the two equations, the coefficients of the polynomials can be determined. This is useful for simplifying and manipulating polynomial equations, as it can help to reduce the number of terms in an equation.
