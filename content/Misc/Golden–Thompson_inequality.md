# Goldenâ€“Thompson inequality

Golden-Thompson inequality is a mathematical rule that states that the trace of a matrix product is always greater than or equal to the trace of a matrix formed by taking the geometric mean of the two matrices. This means that if two matrices, A and B, are multiplied together, the trace of the product of A and B is always greater than or equal to the trace of the matrix formed by taking the geometric mean of A and B. This inequality is important in many areas of mathematics and physics, such as quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.
