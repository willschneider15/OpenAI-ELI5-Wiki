# Reducing subspace

Reducing subspace is a way to make a complex process simpler. It is done by taking a large set of data and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This allows us to focus on the most important parts of the data and ignore the less important ones. By reducing the amount of data we have to work with, we can make our analysis more efficient and accurate. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as clustering, principal component analysis, and feature selection. Reducing subspace can help us make better decisions and provide more accurate results.
