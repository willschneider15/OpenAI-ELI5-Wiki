# Adjugate matrix

Adjugate matrix, also known as the adjugate of a matrix, is a matrix that can be used to calculate the inverse of a matrix. It is created by taking the transpose of the cofactor matrix of the original matrix. The cofactor matrix is created by taking the minors of each element and multiplying them by a sign that is determined by the row and column of the element. The adjugate matrix can then be used to calculate the inverse of the original matrix by dividing the adjugate matrix by the determinant of the original matrix.
