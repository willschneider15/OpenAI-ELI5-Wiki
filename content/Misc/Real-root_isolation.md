# Real-root isolation

Real-root isolation is a way of finding the exact solutions of a polynomial equation. It involves breaking down the equation into its component parts, and then using a process of elimination to find the exact solutions. For example, if you have a polynomial equation of x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0, you can break it down into its two parts, x^2 + 3x and -4. Then, you can use the process of elimination to find the exact solutions by subtracting the two parts and solving for x. In this case, the exact solutions would be x = -4 and x = 1. Real-root isolation is a useful tool for finding the exact solutions of a polynomial equation quickly and accurately.
