# Rota's basis conjecture

Rota's Basis Conjecture is a mathematical statement proposed by Gian-Carlo Rota in the 1960s. It states that any vector space over a field can be expressed as a linear combination of a finite set of vectors, called a basis. This means that any vector in the space can be expressed as a combination of the basis vectors. The conjecture is still unproven, but it is an important concept in mathematics, as it has implications for many areas, such as linear algebra and algebraic geometry.
