# Permanent (mathematics)

Permanent is a mathematical concept that is used to determine the number of ways in which a set of numbers can be arranged. It is calculated by multiplying each number in the set together and then adding them all together. For example, if you have a set of numbers {1,2,3}, the permanent would be 1x2x3 = 6. This means that there are 6 different ways in which the numbers can be arranged. Permanent is used in many areas of mathematics, including graph theory, combinatorics, and linear algebra.
