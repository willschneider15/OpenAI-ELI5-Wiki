# Gram–Schmidt process

The Gram–Schmidt process is a way to take a set of vectors and turn them into an orthonormal set of vectors. This means that the vectors will be perpendicular to each other and all have a length of 1. 

To do this, you start with a set of vectors and then use the dot product to find the projection of one vector onto the other. You then subtract this projection from the original vector and normalize the result to get the new vector. This process is repeated for each vector in the set until you have an orthonormal set. 

The Gram–Schmidt process is useful for many applications, such as solving linear equations and finding the eigenvectors of a matrix.
