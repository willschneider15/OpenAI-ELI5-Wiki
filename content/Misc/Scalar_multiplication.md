# Scalar multiplication

Scalar multiplication is a mathematical operation that multiplies a vector (or matrix) by a scalar (a single number). This operation can be used to stretch or shrink a vector or matrix, depending on the scalar value. 

For example, if a vector is multiplied by a scalar value of 2, the vector will be stretched by a factor of two. This means that each component of the vector will be multiplied by two, resulting in a vector that is twice as long as the original vector. 

On the other hand, if a vector is multiplied by a scalar value of 0.5, the vector will be shrunk by a factor of two. This means that each component of the vector will be divided by two, resulting in a vector that is half as long as the original vector. 

In summary, scalar multiplication is a mathematical operation that multiplies a vector (or matrix) by a scalar (a single number). This operation can be used to stretch or shrink a vector or matrix, depending on the scalar value.
