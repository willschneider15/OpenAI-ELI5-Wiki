# Matrix addition

Matrix addition is a mathematical operation that allows us to add two matrices together. Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, usually written in rows and columns. To add two matrices together, you must make sure that they have the same number of rows and columns. 

To add two matrices together, you start by adding the numbers in the same positions (or "cells") of the two matrices. For example, if you have two matrices with the numbers 3 and 5 in the same cell, you would add the two numbers together to get 8. Then, you would write the number 8 in the same cell in the new matrix. You would repeat this process for each cell in the two matrices. 

Once you've added all of the numbers together, you will have a new matrix that is the result of adding the two matrices together. This new matrix will have the same number of rows and columns as the two matrices that you started with.
