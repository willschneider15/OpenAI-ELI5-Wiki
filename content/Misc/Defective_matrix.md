# Defective matrix

A defective matrix is a matrix that does not have the same number of rows and columns. This means that the number of elements in the matrix is not equal to the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. Defective matrices can have either more columns than rows, or more rows than columns. 

In mathematics, a defective matrix is often used to solve a system of linear equations. This is done by adding extra equations to the system to make the matrix square. This extra equation is called an augmented equation, and it helps to make the matrix square so that it can be solved. 

Defective matrices can also be used to solve linear programming problems. In this case, the extra equation is used to make the matrix have the same number of rows and columns. This allows the linear programming problem to be solved. 

Defective matrices can also be used in other areas of mathematics, such as graph theory and linear algebra. In these cases, the extra equation is used to make the matrix more symmetric, which helps to make calculations easier. 

Overall, a defective matrix is a matrix that does not have the same number of rows and columns. It is often used to solve
