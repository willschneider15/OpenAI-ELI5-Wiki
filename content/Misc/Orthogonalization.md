# Orthogonalization

Orthogonalization is a way of organizing data into a set of vectors, or lines, that are all perpendicular to each other. This is done by taking a set of data points and creating a line that best fits them. Then, the line is rotated so that it is perpendicular to the original line. This process is repeated until all of the lines are perpendicular to each other. Orthogonalization is useful because it can help make data easier to analyze and interpret. It can also help reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed, which can save time and resources.
