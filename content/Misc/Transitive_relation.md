# Transitive relation

A transitive relation is a mathematical concept that describes a relationship between two elements of a set. It is a type of binary relation where, if an element a is related to an element b and element b is related to element c, then element a is also related to element c. In other words, if a relation holds between two elements, and a second relation holds between those two elements and a third element, then the first relation must also hold between the first and third elements. 

For example, if a is greater than b, and b is greater than c, then it follows that a is also greater than c. Transitive relations are also known as transitive closures. They can be used to determine if a set of elements is connected, or if there is a path between two elements in a graph.
