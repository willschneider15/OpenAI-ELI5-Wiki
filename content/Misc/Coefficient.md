# Coefficient

Coefficient is a number that is used to measure how two different variables are related. It can help us understand how much one variable changes when the other variable changes. For example, if you are trying to predict how much money someone will make based on their education level, the coefficient will tell you how much more money someone will make for each additional year of education. Coefficients can range from -1 to 1, with -1 meaning that the two variables are completely opposite and 1 meaning that the two variables are completely the same.
