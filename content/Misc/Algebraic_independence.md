# Algebraic independence

Algebraic independence is a concept that refers to the ability of two or more mathematical expressions to be independent from one another. This means that the expressions do not rely on each other for their value or meaning. For example, if two equations are algebraically independent, then changing one equation will not affect the other. Algebraic independence is important because it helps us to understand how different equations interact with each other and how they can be combined to solve problems.
