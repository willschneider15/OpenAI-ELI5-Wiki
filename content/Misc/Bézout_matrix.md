# Bézout matrix

A Bézout matrix is a type of matrix used in mathematics to help solve linear equations. It is named after the French mathematician Étienne Bézout. The matrix is composed of two rows and two columns. The first row contains the coefficients of the two variables in the linear equation, and the second row contains the constants. The columns contain the coefficients of the two variables and the constants. By using a Bézout matrix, it is possible to solve linear equations quickly and easily. For example, if the linear equation is 3x + 4y = 7, the Bézout matrix would be: 

|  3  |  4  |  7  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  x  |  y  |     |

The solution to the equation is then found by using the Bézout matrix to calculate the values of x and y. In this example, x = 1 and y = -1.
