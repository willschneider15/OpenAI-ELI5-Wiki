# Bombieri norm

Bombieri norm is a mathematical concept that is used to measure the size of a mathematical object. It is based on the idea of the Euclidean norm, which is the length of a vector. The Bombieri norm is a modified version of the Euclidean norm that takes into account the size of the vector's components. It is sometimes also referred to as the "norm of the vector".

The Bombieri norm is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute values of the vector's components and then dividing by the number of components. This gives an indication of the size of the vector and allows it to be compared to other vectors.

The Bombieri norm is used in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, numerical analysis, and optimization. It is also used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, as it can be used to measure the size of a vector of weights in a neural network.
