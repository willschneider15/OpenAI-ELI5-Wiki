# Definite quadratic form

A definite quadratic form is a type of mathematical expression that involves a squared term and a linear term. It is used to describe relationships between variables in a two-dimensional space. The form is written as:

$$ax^2 + bx + c$$

Where a, b, and c are constants.

The term 'definite' refers to the fact that the expression has a definite value when the variables are given a particular value. This value can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the constants and the value of the variables.

Definite quadratic forms can be used to determine the maximum or minimum value of a function. They can also be used to determine the shape of a graph and the nature of the relationship between variables.
