# Prime avoidance lemma

The Prime Avoidance Lemma is a rule of thumb used in mathematics to help simplify proofs. It states that if a statement is true for all prime numbers, then it is true for all numbers. This means that if a proof can be shown for a prime number, then it can be assumed to be true for all numbers. This lemma helps to reduce the complexity of proofs by removing the need to check every possible number. This makes proofs much simpler and easier to understand.
