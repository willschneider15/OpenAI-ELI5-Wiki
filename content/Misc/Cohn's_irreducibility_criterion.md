# Cohn's irreducibility criterion

Cohn's irreducibility criterion is a way to determine whether a polynomial is irreducible (cannot be broken down into simpler factors) or not. It states that if a polynomial can be written as the product of two polynomials and one of them has a degree that is greater than half of the degree of the original polynomial, then the polynomial is reducible.

For example, if we have a polynomial with degree 4, then the degree of one of the two polynomials that make up the product must be 2 or less. If it is greater than 2, then the polynomial is reducible. If it is 2 or less, then the polynomial is irreducible.
