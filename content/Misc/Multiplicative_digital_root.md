# Multiplicative digital root

The multiplicative digital root (MDR) is a concept used to determine the sum of a number's digits when multiplied together. This is done by breaking the number down into its individual digits, multiplying them together, and then repeating the process until a single digit is reached. For example, if the number is 150, the MDR would be 3, because 1*5*0=0, and 0+0=0, and 0+3=3. The MDR can be used to quickly determine the sum of a number's digits without having to add them together manually. This can be especially useful for large numbers or calculations.
