# Invertible matrix

Invertible matrices are matrices that can be "inverted" or transformed into another matrix. This is done by multiplying the matrix by its inverse, which is a matrix with the same dimensions as the original matrix but with all the elements in the opposite order. This inverse matrix can then be used to solve equations and systems of equations. Invertible matrices are also referred to as non-singular or regular matrices. A matrix is considered invertible if its determinant is not equal to zero. Determinant is a value that is calculated from the elements of the matrix and is used to determine the invertibility of a matrix. Invertible matrices are important in linear algebra and are used to solve various problems such as finding the inverse of a matrix, finding the solution to a system of linear equations, and computing the determinant of a matrix.
