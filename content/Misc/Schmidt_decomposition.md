# Schmidt decomposition

Schmidt decomposition is a way of breaking down a quantum state into simpler components. It is named after physicist Erwin Schmidt, who first proposed the idea in the early 1900s. 

To understand Schmidt decomposition, imagine a quantum state is like a cake. The cake can be broken down into smaller pieces, or components. Each of these components can be described by a quantum state. 

Schmidt decomposition takes the original quantum state and breaks it down into its components. The components are then described mathematically. This is done by using a mathematical equation called the Schmidt decomposition equation. 

This equation takes the original quantum state and breaks it down into its components. It also provides information about the probability of each component. This information can be used to understand the behavior of the quantum state. 

Schmidt decomposition is an important tool for understanding quantum physics. It can help scientists understand the behavior of quantum states and can be used to develop new technologies.
