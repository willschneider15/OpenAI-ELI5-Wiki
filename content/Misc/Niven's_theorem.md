# Niven's theorem

Niven's theorem is a mathematical concept that states that any number that can be divided by the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. For example, if you have the number 24, it can be divided by the sum of its digits (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, 24 is a multiple of 9. This theorem can be used to quickly determine if a number is divisible by 9.
