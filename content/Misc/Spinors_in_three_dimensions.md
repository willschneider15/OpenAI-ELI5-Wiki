# Spinors in three dimensions

Spinors are mathematical objects that describe the orientation of a three dimensional object in space. They are related to vectors, but they are different in that they are not affected by rotations. Instead, they are affected by a different type of transformation called a Lorentz transformation. This transformation changes the length of a vector and its direction in a specific way, while preserving its orientation. Spinors are useful in physics because they can be used to describe the behavior of particles in three dimensions. They are also used in quantum mechanics to describe the behavior of particles with spin.
