# Linear combination

Linear combination is a mathematical concept that describes the addition of two or more vectors to create a new vector. It is a way of combining two or more vectors to form a single vector. This combined vector is the sum of the individual vectors that were added together. Each vector is multiplied by a scalar (a number) to determine the magnitude of the combined vector. 

The linear combination of two vectors is often used in physics, engineering, and other sciences to describe the motion of objects in space. It can also be used to solve systems of linear equations. Linear combinations can be used to find the sum of several vectors, the difference between two vectors, or the product of two vectors.

In summary, linear combination is a way of combining two or more vectors to form a new vector. It is used to solve linear equations and to describe the motion of objects in space. Each vector is multiplied by a scalar to determine the magnitude of the combined vector.
