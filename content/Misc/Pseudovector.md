# Pseudovector

Pseudovectors are mathematical objects that behave like vectors in some ways, but not in others. They have a magnitude, or size, and direction, like a vector, but they don't have the same properties as a vector when it comes to how they interact with other objects. For example, when two vectors are multiplied together, the result is a vector with twice the magnitude and twice the direction. But when two pseudovectors are multiplied together, the result is not a pseudovector. Instead, it is a scalar, which is a number with no direction. Pseudovectors are used in physics to describe certain types of forces, such as torque and angular momentum.
