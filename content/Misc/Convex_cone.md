# Convex cone

A convex cone is a three-dimensional shape that has a pointy top and a curved base. It looks like an upside-down ice cream cone. The curved base is called the base of the cone, and the pointy top is called the apex. The sides of the cone form a curved line that connects the base to the apex.

A convex cone is a special type of shape because all of the points inside the cone are closer to the apex than any of the points on the outside of the cone. This means that if you draw a line from the apex to any point inside the cone, the line will never cross the boundary of the cone. This makes the convex cone a very useful shape for geometry and engineering.

A convex cone can also be used to describe the shape of a mountain or hill. The apex of the cone is the peak, and the base is the base of the mountain. All of the points inside the cone are closer to the peak than any of the points on the outside of the cone.

In summary, a convex cone is a three-dimensional shape with a pointy top and a curved base. All of the points inside the cone are closer
