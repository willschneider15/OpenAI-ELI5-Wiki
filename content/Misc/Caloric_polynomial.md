# Caloric polynomial

A Caloric polynomial is a mathematical expression used to describe the amount of energy released when a substance is burned. It is a way to measure the amount of heat energy released when a certain amount of the substance is burned. The polynomial is written in the form of a polynomial equation, where the coefficients represent the amount of heat energy released per unit of the substance. For example, if a substance has a Caloric polynomial of ax^2 + bx + c, then the amount of heat energy released when x units of the substance is burned is equal to ax^2 + bx + c. This equation can be used to calculate the energy released when a certain amount of the substance is burned, which can then be used to determine the amount of energy needed to perform certain tasks.
