# Self-adjoint

A self-adjoint is a type of mathematical object that is symmetrical in some way. It can refer to a matrix, a function, or an operator.

In the case of a matrix, it means that the matrix is equal to its transpose, which means that if you flip the matrix over, it looks the same.

In the case of a function or operator, it means that the function or operator is its own inverse, which means that if you apply the function or operator to something, and then apply it again, it has the same effect as if you had done nothing.

In all cases, self-adjoint objects are important in mathematics because they can be used to simplify and solve problems.
