# Uwe Storch

Uwe Storch is a concept developed by German educator Uwe Storch. It is based on the idea that children should be encouraged to be creative and independent learners. The concept focuses on the idea that children should be given the opportunity to explore their own interests and talents, and to develop their own unique learning style. Uwe Storch encourages children to take ownership of their learning, and to take risks in order to discover new knowledge. It also emphasizes the importance of a supportive learning environment, where children are encouraged to ask questions and to express their ideas. Uwe Storch encourages teachers to be facilitators rather than instructors, and to provide an environment in which children can develop their own skills and knowledge.
