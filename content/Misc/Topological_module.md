# Topological module

Topological modules are mathematical objects that can be used to study the properties of shapes and spaces. They are used to describe the relationships between points, lines, and surfaces in a space. A topological module is a set of points, lines, and surfaces that can be combined to form a space. The points, lines, and surfaces are connected to each other in a way that allows them to move and deform without changing the overall structure of the space. The structure of the space can be studied by looking at the way the points, lines, and surfaces are connected. Topological modules are used in many different areas of mathematics, including topology, geometry, and algebra.
