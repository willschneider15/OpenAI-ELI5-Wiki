# First and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory

The First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Invariant Theory are two theorems that describe the relationship between symmetries and polynomial equations. The First Fundamental Theorem states that all polynomial equations are invariant under a group of symmetries, meaning that any group of symmetries can be used to transform a polynomial equation into another polynomial equation with the same solution set. The Second Fundamental Theorem states that any polynomial equation can be written as a combination of invariants, which are polynomials that are invariant under the same group of symmetries. This means that any polynomial equation can be written as a combination of polynomials that are unchanged by the same group of symmetries.
