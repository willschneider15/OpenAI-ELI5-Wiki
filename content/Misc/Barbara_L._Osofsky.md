# Barbara L. Osofsky

Barbara L. Osofsky is an American psychologist who developed the concept of "Family Stress Theory". This theory states that when a family experiences a stressful event, such as the death of a family member, the family must adjust to the new situation in order to maintain their wellbeing. 

The theory suggests that the family must go through a period of adjustment, which includes the family members learning to cope with the new situation, and making changes to their lives to accommodate the new reality. This can include changing routines, developing new coping strategies, and learning how to communicate better. 

Once the family has gone through the adjustment period, they can then begin to move forward and rebuild their lives. The family must also learn how to support each other and work together to manage the stress and build a strong, supportive family unit. 

Family Stress Theory is an important concept that helps families understand how to cope with difficult situations and provides them with the tools to build a strong and healthy family.
