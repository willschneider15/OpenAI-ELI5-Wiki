# Linearly disjoint

Linearly disjoint is a concept used in mathematics to describe two or more sets of numbers that have no common elements. The sets are considered to be "disjoint" if there is no overlap between them. For example, if we have two sets of numbers, A = {1,2,3} and B = {4,5,6}, then A and B are linearly disjoint because none of the elements of A are present in B and none of the elements of B are present in A. This concept is used in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and calculus.
