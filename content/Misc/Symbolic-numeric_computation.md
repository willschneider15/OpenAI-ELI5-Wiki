# Symbolic-numeric computation

Symbolic-numeric computation is a type of computing that combines the use of symbolic and numeric methods. Symbolic methods involve the manipulation of symbols, such as equations, while numeric methods involve the manipulation of numbers. The combination of these two methods allows for a more efficient and accurate computation of complex problems. Symbolic-numeric computation can be used to solve mathematical problems, analyze data, and create models. For example, it can be used to create algorithms to solve problems, such as finding the shortest path between two points, or to analyze data to identify patterns and trends. Symbolic-numeric computation is an important tool for scientists, engineers, and other professionals who need to solve complex problems.
