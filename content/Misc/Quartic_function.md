# Quartic function

A quartic function is a type of polynomial equation with four terms, each containing a variable raised to the fourth power. The general form of a quartic equation is: 

ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0

where a, b, c, d and e are constants. Quartic equations can have both real and complex solutions, depending on the constants and the variable.

Quartic equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factorization, completing the square and numerical methods. Solutions to quartic equations can be used to find solutions to a variety of problems, such as finding the speed of a ball rolling down an incline or the maximum height of a projectile.

Quartic equations are also useful in the study of physics, engineering and mathematics. They can be used to model physical phenomena, such as the motion of a pendulum or the trajectory of a rocket. They can also be used to solve mathematical problems, such as finding the roots of a polynomial or determining the area of a circle.
