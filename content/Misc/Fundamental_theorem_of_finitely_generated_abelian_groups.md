# Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups

The Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups states that any finitely generated abelian group can be written as a direct sum of cyclic groups. A cyclic group is a group with a single generator, which means that all of its elements can be generated from a single element by repeatedly applying the group operation. This theorem is important because it allows us to break down any finitely generated abelian group into its component parts, making it easier to understand and work with.
