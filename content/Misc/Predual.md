# Predual

Predual is a mathematical concept that describes the relationship between two objects. It is a way to compare two objects in terms of their properties, or characteristics.

Think of it like a mirror image. When two objects are in predual, they are similar in some ways, but also different in some ways. For example, two shapes can be in predual if one is the exact opposite of the other.

Predual is also used to describe relationships between objects that have an inverse relationship. For example, if one object is increasing, the other object is decreasing.

Predual is an important concept in mathematics because it helps us to understand the relationships between objects and how they interact with each other. It can also help us to make predictions about how two objects will interact in the future.
