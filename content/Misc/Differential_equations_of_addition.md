# Differential equations of addition

Differential equations of addition are equations that involve the derivatives of a function. These equations are used to model physical phenomena such as motion, heat transfer, and electrical circuits. The equations are written in terms of the derivatives of the function, which are changes in the function over time. The derivatives can be used to determine the rate of change of the function, as well as its behavior over time. Differential equations of addition can also be used to solve for unknown variables in a system.
