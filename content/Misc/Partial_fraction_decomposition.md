# Partial fraction decomposition

Partial fraction decomposition is a way of breaking down a fraction into simpler parts. It is used to simplify complicated fractions. It works by splitting a fraction into two or more fractions that can be added together to make the original fraction. To do this, you must factor the denominator of the fraction and then use the factors to create the new fractions. The numerators of the new fractions will be determined by solving a system of equations. Partial fraction decomposition can be used to solve integrals and can make solving complicated integrals much easier.
