# Zassenhaus algorithm

Zassenhaus algorithm is a way of finding the square root of a number. It works by breaking the number down into smaller pieces and then adding them together to get the square root. To do this, you first divide the number into two parts and then add the two parts together. Then, you take the square root of the result and add it to the original number. The process is repeated until the square root is found. This algorithm is simple and efficient, making it a popular choice for finding square roots.
