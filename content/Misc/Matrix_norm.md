# Matrix norm

Matrix norm is a way of measuring how large a matrix is. It is calculated by taking the largest absolute value of the elements in the matrix and then taking the square root of that value. Matrix norm is important because it can be used to measure how much a matrix is changing when it is multiplied by another matrix. This helps us to understand the behavior of matrices and how they interact with each other. Matrix norm is also used to measure the error of an approximation of a matrix.
