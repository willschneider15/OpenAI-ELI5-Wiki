# Integrable module

Integrable modules are mathematical objects that can be integrated over a given domain. They are used to solve a variety of problems in mathematics, such as finding the area of a shape or finding the volume of a solid. Integrable modules are usually constructed from a set of basic functions, such as polynomials or trigonometric functions. These functions can then be combined to create more complex integrable modules. These modules allow for the efficient calculation of integrals, which can then be used to solve a variety of problems.
