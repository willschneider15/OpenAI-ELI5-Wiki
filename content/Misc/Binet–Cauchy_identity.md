# Binet–Cauchy identity

Binet–Cauchy identity is a mathematical equation used to calculate the sum of an infinite sequence of numbers. It is named after French mathematicians Jacques Binet and Augustin-Louis Cauchy. 

The identity states that the sum of an infinite sequence is equal to the product of the first and last terms of the sequence, divided by two. For example, if the sequence is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, the sum of the sequence is 30, and the product of the first and last terms is 20. When divided by two, the result is 10, which is the same as the sum of the sequence. 

The Binet–Cauchy identity is useful for calculating the sum of an infinite sequence without having to add up all the terms. This makes it a time-saving tool for mathematicians.
