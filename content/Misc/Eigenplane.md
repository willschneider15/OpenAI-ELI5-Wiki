# Eigenplane

An eigenplane is a mathematical concept that helps describe the shape of a 3-dimensional object. It is a plane that is determined by the eigenvectors of a 3-dimensional matrix. An eigenvector is a vector that, when multiplied by a matrix, results in the same vector, but scaled by some factor. The eigenvectors of a 3-dimensional matrix, when plotted in a 3-dimensional space, form a plane, which is known as an eigenplane. This plane can help describe the shape of an object, and can be used for object recognition and classification.
