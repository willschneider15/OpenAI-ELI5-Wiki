# Reduct

Reduct is a concept that helps us understand how to make decisions. It is based on the idea that we should only consider the information that is relevant to the decision we are trying to make. By reducing the amount of information we consider, we can make better decisions faster. For example, if you are trying to decide which car to buy, you don't need to consider the car's color, since that won't affect the performance of the car. Reduct helps us focus on the important information and ignore the rest.
