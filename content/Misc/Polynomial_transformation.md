# Polynomial transformation

Polynomial transformation is a process of transforming a polynomial expression. It involves changing the variables and coefficients of the polynomial equation, while keeping the degree of the equation the same. This process can be used to simplify a polynomial expression, or to solve a polynomial equation. For example, if a polynomial expression is given as `3x^2 + 2x + 1`, it can be transformed into `x^2 + 2x + 3` by changing the coefficients. This transformation can then be used to solve the equation.
