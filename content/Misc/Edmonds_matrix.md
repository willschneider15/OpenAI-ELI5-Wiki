# Edmonds matrix

Edmonds Matrix is a type of graph used in mathematics to represent relationships between objects. It is named after the mathematician Jack Edmonds, who developed the concept.

In an Edmonds Matrix, each object is represented by a row and column in a two-dimensional grid. The objects are connected to each other by arrows, which indicate the relationship between the two objects. For example, a row could represent a person, and the column could represent a hobby. An arrow from the person to the hobby would indicate that the person enjoys that hobby.

Edmonds Matrices are useful for representing complex relationships between objects, such as those found in social networks or other types of networks. They can also be used to represent relationships between objects in a mathematical problem, such as finding the shortest path between two points.
