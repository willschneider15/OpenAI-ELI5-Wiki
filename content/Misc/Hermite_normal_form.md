# Hermite normal form

Hermite normal form (HNF) is a way of writing a matrix in a specific way. It is used to find the solutions to certain types of equations. It is named after Charles Hermite, a French mathematician.

In HNF, a matrix is written so that all of the entries above and below the main diagonal are zero. This means that the matrix is in a simplified form, and that it can be used to solve equations more easily.

HNF is used in linear algebra and other fields to solve equations and find solutions. It can also be used to simplify matrices and make them easier to work with.

HNF is a useful tool for mathematicians and scientists, as it can help them find solutions to equations more quickly and easily.
