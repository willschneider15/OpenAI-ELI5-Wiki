# FGLM algorithm

FGLM stands for "Fourier Generalized Least Mean Squares". It is an algorithm that is used to identify and estimate parameters in a linear system. This algorithm works by taking a Fourier transform of the input data and then using the transform to identify the parameters of the linear system. Once the parameters are identified, the FGLM algorithm can then be used to estimate the parameters of the linear system. This algorithm is often used in signal processing and control systems to identify and estimate the parameters of a system.
