# Canonical basis

Canonical basis is a set of vectors that are used to describe a vector space. It is a basis that is uniquely determined by the vector space and is often used to simplify calculations. In other words, it is a set of vectors that can be used to express any vector in the vector space. It is often used to simplify the process of solving linear equations and can be used to identify the elements of a vector space. Canonical basis is a powerful tool that can help make calculations easier and more efficient.
