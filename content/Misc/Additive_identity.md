# Additive identity

The additive identity is a concept in mathematics that states that when any number is added to zero, the result is that same number. This concept is based on the idea of the identity element, which is an element in a set that, when combined with other elements in the set, will not change the value of those elements. 

In algebra, the additive identity is represented by the number 0. This means that any number added to 0 will result in that same number. For example, if 3 is added to 0, the result is 3. This concept is also known as the zero property of addition.

The additive identity is an important concept in mathematics because it is used to simplify equations. For example, if a number is added to both sides of an equation, the additive identity can be used to show that the equation still holds true. 

The additive identity is also used in other areas of mathematics, such as in calculus and linear algebra. In calculus, the additive identity is used to show that the derivative of a constant is equal to 0. In linear algebra, the additive identity is used to show that the sum of two vectors is equal to the original vector.

Overall, the additive identity is
