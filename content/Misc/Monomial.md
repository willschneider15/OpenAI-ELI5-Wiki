# Monomial

A **monomial** is a mathematical expression that is made up of only one term. It can contain constants, variables, and exponents, but all of these must be multiplied together. For example, `3x^2` is a monomial because it has only one term (`3x^2`).

Monomials can also be divided into two types: **like terms** and **unlike terms**. Like terms are monomials that have the same variables and exponents, such as `2x^2` and `4x^2`. Unlike terms have different variables and/or exponents, such as `2x^2` and `3y^3`.

Monomials are important in algebra because they can be used to solve equations and simplify expressions. For example, if you have the expression `2x^2 + 3y^3`, you can simplify it by combining the like terms to get `5x^2 + 3y^3`.
