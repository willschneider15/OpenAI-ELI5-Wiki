# Étienne Bézout

Étienne Bézout was a French mathematician who lived in the 18th century. He is best known for his work on solving equations, which is called Bézout's theorem. The theorem states that for any two polynomials, there is a solution to the equation. This means that if two polynomials are given, then it is possible to find the values of the variables that make the equation true.

To understand Bézout's theorem, it's helpful to think of it like a puzzle. If two polynomials are given, then the goal is to find the values of the variables that make the equation true. To do this, Bézout developed a method of breaking down the equation into simpler parts, which can then be solved. This process is called factoring.

Bézout's theorem is an important tool in mathematics, as it can be used to solve a wide variety of equations. It is also used in computer science, as it can be used to find the solutions to complex problems. Bézout's theorem is a great example of how mathematics can be used to solve real-world problems.
