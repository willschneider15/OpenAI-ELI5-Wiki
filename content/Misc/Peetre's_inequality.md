# Peetre's inequality

Peetre's inequality is a mathematical inequality which states that the sum of two non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the product of those two numbers. This means that if two non-negative numbers, a and b, are added together then the result will always be greater than or equal to the product of those two numbers.

This inequality is useful in mathematics, particularly in the field of optimization. It can be used to prove that certain problems have a minimum or maximum value and can also be used to prove that certain problems can be solved in a certain way.

Peetre's inequality is also useful in the field of computer science. It can be used to prove that certain algorithms are optimal and can be used to prove that certain algorithms are efficient.

Peetre's inequality is an important concept in mathematics and computer science and is used to prove the optimality and efficiency of certain algorithms and problems.
