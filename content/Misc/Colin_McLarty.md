# Colin McLarty

Colin McLarty is a philosopher who believes that the way we think about the world can be divided into two categories: the metaphysical and the epistemological. The metaphysical is how we think about the world in terms of what it is, while the epistemological is how we think about the world in terms of how we know it. McLarty believes that the two perspectives should be balanced in order to gain a better understanding of the world. He also believes that there are two types of knowledge: propositional knowledge, which is knowledge that can be stated in a sentence, and practical knowledge, which is knowledge that is gained through experience. By understanding both types of knowledge, we can better understand the world around us. McLarty's philosophy helps us to think more deeply about the world and how we interact with it.
