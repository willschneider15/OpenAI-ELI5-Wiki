# Line–line intersection

Line–line intersection is when two lines meet at one point. It is a basic concept in geometry. 

A line is a straight path that goes on forever in both directions. When two lines cross each other, they form an intersection point. This intersection point is where the lines meet and it is the only point where the two lines are connected.

To find the intersection point of two lines, you need to draw the two lines on a graph and then look for the point where they cross. If the lines are parallel, they will not intersect.

Line–line intersection is an important concept in mathematics, as it is used to solve equations and graph lines. It is also used to find the area of shapes and calculate angles.
