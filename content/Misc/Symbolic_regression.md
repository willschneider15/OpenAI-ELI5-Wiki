# Symbolic regression

Symbolic regression is a type of machine learning that uses mathematical equations to make predictions. It works by taking a set of data and finding the mathematical equation that best fits the data. This equation is then used to make predictions about future data. Symbolic regression can be used to solve complex problems such as predicting stock prices or understanding customer behavior. It is a powerful tool that can help us make better decisions and understand the world around us.
