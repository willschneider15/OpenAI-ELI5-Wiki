# Algebraic equation

An algebraic equation is an equation that contains one or more variables, which represent unknown values. It is used to find the value of the variable by using arithmetic operations and other mathematical operations. For example, if you are given the equation `2x+3=7`, you can solve it by subtracting 3 from both sides, which will give you `2x=4`. Then, you can divide both sides by 2, giving you `x=2`. Therefore, the value of x is 2. Algebraic equations can be used to solve many real-life problems, such as finding the cost of an item given its price and the amount of tax.
