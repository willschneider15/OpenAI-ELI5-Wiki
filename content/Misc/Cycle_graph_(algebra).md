# Cycle graph (algebra)

A cycle graph is a type of graph in algebra which consists of a series of vertices connected in a circular fashion. Each vertex is connected to two other vertices, forming a cycle. The cycle graph is a useful tool for representing equations and solving problems. For example, if one knows the values of two points on the graph, the other points can be determined by solving the equation. Additionally, the cycle graph can be used to illustrate the relationships between different variables in an equation. Cycle graphs are also used to illustrate the behavior of functions, such as the sinusoidal function. By plotting points on the graph, one can determine the behavior of the function at various points.
