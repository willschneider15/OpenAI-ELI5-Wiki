# Yoneda product

Yoneda product is a concept in mathematics that helps to relate two different mathematical objects. It is a way to combine two objects together to create a new object. 

The Yoneda product works by taking two objects, such as sets, and mapping them together. This mapping is called a homomorphism. This homomorphism creates a new object, called the Yoneda product, which is composed of the two original objects. This product can then be used to answer questions about the two original objects. 

For example, if you have two sets A and B, the Yoneda product can be used to answer questions about how the two sets interact. This could be questions such as how many elements are in the intersection of the two sets, or what the union of the two sets is. 

Overall, Yoneda product is a useful tool for relating two mathematical objects. It can be used to answer questions about the interaction between the two objects, and can help to better understand the relationship between them.
