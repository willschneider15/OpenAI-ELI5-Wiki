# Hochster–Roberts theorem

Hochster–Roberts theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that if two algebraic varieties intersect in a finite number of points, then they must intersect in a single point. This theorem is important because it helps us understand the relationship between two algebraic varieties. In other words, it helps us determine how two algebraic varieties intersect with each other. In simpler terms, it tells us if two things can fit together perfectly or if they have to be adjusted in order for them to fit together.
