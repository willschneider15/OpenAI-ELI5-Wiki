# Synthetic division

Synthetic division is a shorthand method of dividing polynomials. It is used to divide a polynomial by a binomial of the form x - c, where c is a constant. The method is commonly used to divide polynomials of degree three or less, and it is especially useful for dividing by a factor of x + c.

Synthetic division works by writing the coefficients of the polynomial in a row, followed by a zero, and then dividing by the binomial. Each coefficient is divided by the first coefficient of the binomial, and then the results are multiplied by the binomial and subtracted from the original polynomial. This process is repeated until the last coefficient is reached.

The result of the synthetic division is the quotient of the polynomial divided by the binomial, along with the remainder. The remainder is the remainder of the division, and it is the last coefficient in the synthetic division.

Synthetic division is a useful tool for quickly dividing polynomials by binomials, and it is especially useful for dividing by a factor of x + c. It can save time and effort when dividing polynomials,
