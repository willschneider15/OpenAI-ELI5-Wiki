# Jacobi triple product

Jacobi Triple Product is a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between three numbers. It states that the product of three numbers is equal to the sum of their cubes divided by the product of their squares. This formula has many applications in mathematics, including number theory, algebra, and calculus. It is also used in physics, where it can be used to calculate the force between two particles. The Jacobi Triple Product is an important tool for understanding the behavior of numbers in various contexts.
