# Degen's eight-square identity

Degen's eight-square identity is a mathematical concept that states that the sum of any eight numbers arranged in a square will always be the same.

To understand this concept, imagine 8 numbers in a square, like this:

| a | b |
|---|---|
| c | d |
| e | f |
| g | h |

The sum of these 8 numbers is always the same, no matter what the numbers are. This is known as Degen's Eight-Square Identity.

The formula for this is:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = a + d + g + b + e + h + c + f

This concept can be used to solve many mathematical problems. For example, if you know the sum of the 8 numbers, you can use the formula to determine the value of any of the numbers.
