# Fierz identity

Fierz identity is a mathematical equation that relates the components of a spin-2 field (like the graviton) to each other. It states that the product of two symmetric, rank-2 tensors (like the energy-momentum tensor) is equal to the sum of two terms: one that is symmetric and one that is antisymmetric. This equation helps us understand the behavior of particles with spin-2, and it can be used to simplify calculations involving these particles. It is an important tool for physicists studying the behavior of particles with spin-2, like the graviton.
