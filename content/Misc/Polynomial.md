# Polynomial

Polynomials are like math puzzles. They are equations made up of numbers, variables, and operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Variables are like letters that can stand for numbers. In a polynomial, the variables are raised to a power, like squares or cubes. The numbers in the equation are called coefficients. The highest power of the variable is called the degree. To solve a polynomial, you have to figure out what the variables stand for. You do this by using the coefficients and operations to make the equation equal zero. Then you can use the answers to the equation to figure out what the variable stands for.
