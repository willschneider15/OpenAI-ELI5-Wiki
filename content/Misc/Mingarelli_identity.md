# Mingarelli identity

Mingarelli identity is a concept of identity that was developed by Italian sociologist Ugo Mingarelli. It focuses on how individuals interact with others and how their identity is shaped by their relationships. Mingarelli proposed that identity is not something that is fixed, but instead is constantly changing and evolving. He argued that identity is formed through the development of relationships, and that it is not static but rather something that is constantly in flux. Mingarelli argued that identity is formed by the interactions between individuals, and that the identity of an individual is shaped by the relationships they have with others. He further argued that identity is not only shaped by the people around us, but also by our beliefs and values. Therefore, identity is something that is constantly changing and evolving, and is shaped by the relationships we form with others.
