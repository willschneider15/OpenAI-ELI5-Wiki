# Sum of two cubes

The sum of two cubes is a mathematical concept that involves adding two cubes together. A cube is a three-dimensional object with six faces, each of which is a square. The sum of two cubes is the result of adding the two cubes together, resulting in a new cube with the same number of faces, but with a larger volume.

The sum of two cubes can be represented mathematically as a^3 + b^3. In this equation, “a” and “b” are two different numbers that are cubed, or raised to the third power. The result of this equation is a new number, which is the sum of the two cubes.

The sum of two cubes can also be represented graphically. When two cubes are added together, the result is a larger cube with the same number of faces, but with a larger volume. This can be seen by adding two cubes of different sizes together, which results in a larger cube with the same number of faces.

The sum of two cubes is a useful concept in mathematics, as it can be used to solve equations and problems. It can also be used to calculate the volume of a cube, as well as the surface
