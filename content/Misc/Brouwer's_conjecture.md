# Brouwer's conjecture

Brouwer's Conjecture is a mathematical statement that says that any shape that is drawn can be cut into pieces and reassembled into a different shape. This statement has never been proven, and it is still a mystery today. To understand it better, imagine a piece of paper with a shape drawn on it. The conjecture says that, no matter what shape is drawn, it can be cut into pieces and rearranged into a different shape. This is a difficult concept for young children to understand, but it is an important part of mathematics.
