# Buchberger's algorithm

Buchberger's algorithm is a way of solving mathematical problems. It works by taking a set of equations and using an algorithm to find a solution. The algorithm starts by looking at each equation and finding the highest common factor (HCF) of the terms. It then uses the HCF to create a new equation. This process is repeated until all the equations have been solved. The result is a set of solutions that can be used to solve the original problem. The algorithm is useful because it can quickly and accurately find solutions to complex equations.
