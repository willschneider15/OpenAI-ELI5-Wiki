# Canonical form

Canonical form is a way of representing data in a standard, organized way. It is used to make data easier to understand, process, and store. Canonical form helps to ensure data is consistent and can be used across multiple systems.

In computing, canonical form is used to represent data in a consistent, standard way. For example, a text string may be represented in a canonical form by converting all characters to lowercase and removing any extra spaces. This ensures that the data will be the same no matter where it is used.

Canonical form can also be used to represent data in a structured way. For example, a date might be represented in a canonical form by using the ISO 8601 standard, which specifies the date format as YYYY-MM-DD. This makes it easier to compare and process dates.

Canonical form can help to make data more efficient, reliable, and easier to use. By representing data in a consistent, standard way, it can help to reduce errors and improve the efficiency of data processing.
