# Linear equation over a ring

A linear equation over a ring is a mathematical equation that involves a set of variables and constants, and is solved over a ring. A ring is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of elements, with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) defined on them. The ring can be either commutative or non-commutative.

A linear equation over a ring is an equation in which the variables and constants are multiplied and added together, with the result being equal to zero. The equation is solved by finding a set of values for the variables that makes the equation true. This is done by using the properties of the ring, such as the distributive law, and the closure properties of the ring. 

In summary, a linear equation over a ring is a mathematical equation that is solved over a ring, a mathematical structure consisting of elements and two binary operations, using the properties of the ring.
