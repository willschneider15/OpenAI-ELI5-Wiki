# Symmetric graph

A symmetric graph is a type of graph where the edges between two nodes are equal in both directions. This means that if there is an edge between node A and node B, then there is also an edge between node B and node A. This type of graph is useful for representing relationships between two entities, such as friendships or business partnerships. Symmetric graphs are also useful for visualizing data in a way that is easy to understand.
