# FOIL method

FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. It is a method used to multiply two binomials (two expressions with two terms). 

To use the FOIL method, you first multiply the First terms of each binomial (the terms in the front of the parentheses). Then you multiply the Outer terms (the first term in the first binomial and the second term in the second binomial). Then you multiply the Inner terms (the second term in the first binomial and the first term in the second binomial). Finally, you multiply the Last terms (the terms in the back of the parentheses). 

By breaking the problem down into smaller steps, you can easily multiply two binomials. FOIL is a useful and efficient way to do this.
