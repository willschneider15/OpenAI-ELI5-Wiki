# Proofs involving the addition of natural numbers

Proofs involving the addition of natural numbers are mathematical proofs that demonstrate the validity of a statement involving the addition of two or more natural numbers. These proofs typically involve the use of the mathematical induction method, which involves making an assumption about the validity of a statement, then proving that the statement is true for all natural numbers. This is done by first proving the statement for a specific number, then showing that if it is true for one number, then it must be true for the next natural number as well. This process is then repeated until the statement is proven to be true for all natural numbers. This type of proof is often used to prove theorems involving the addition of natural numbers, as well as other mathematical statements.
