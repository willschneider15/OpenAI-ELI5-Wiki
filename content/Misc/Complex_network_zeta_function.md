# Complex network zeta function

The Complex Network Zeta Function is a mathematical tool used to measure the strength of a network. It is based on the idea that networks with more connections are stronger than those with fewer connections. The function looks at the number of connections between nodes in a network, and calculates a score based on how many connections there are. This score can then be used to compare different networks and measure their strength. The Complex Network Zeta Function is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of complex networks and can be used to identify patterns in networks that would otherwise be difficult to see.
