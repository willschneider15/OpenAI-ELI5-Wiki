# Symplectic vector space

A symplectic vector space is a mathematical space that has a special structure called a symplectic form. This form is a type of bilinear form that is antisymmetric, meaning that it switches its sign when its two arguments are switched. This means that if you take two vectors in the space and multiply them with the symplectic form, the result will be zero. This special structure allows us to solve certain types of equations, like Hamiltonian equations, which describe the motion of particles in physics.
