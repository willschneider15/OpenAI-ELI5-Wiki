# Linear algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear functions. It is used to solve problems involving lines, planes, and other linear objects. 

In linear algebra, you can use equations to solve problems involving lines and planes. To solve these equations, you need to use variables, which represent unknown numbers. You can also use linear functions, which are equations that describe how one variable changes in relation to another variable. 

Linear algebra can be used to solve many problems, such as finding the slope of a line, finding the area of a triangle, or finding the solution to a system of equations. It is also used in many fields, such as engineering, economics, and physics.
