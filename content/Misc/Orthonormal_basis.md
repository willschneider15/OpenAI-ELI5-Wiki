# Orthonormal basis

An orthonormal basis is a set of vectors (or directions) that are mutually perpendicular (at right angles to each other) and have a length of 1. This means that the dot product of any two vectors in the basis is 0, and the dot product of a vector with itself is 1. Orthonormal bases are useful in mathematics and physics because they make it easier to calculate the projections of vectors onto each other and simplify equations. They are also used in signal processing to represent signals in a more efficient way.
