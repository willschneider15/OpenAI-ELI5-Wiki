# Polynomial identity testing

Polynomial identity testing is a method of determining if two polynomials are equal. It is a way to quickly check if two polynomials are the same without having to solve the equations. This is done by evaluating the polynomials on different points and then comparing the results. If the results are the same, then the two polynomials are equal. The main advantage of this method is that it is much faster than solving the equations. This makes it useful for verifying the correctness of algorithms that involve polynomials.
