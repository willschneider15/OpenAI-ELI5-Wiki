# Orientation (vector space)

Orientation is a concept in vector spaces which refers to the direction or angle of a vector. A vector is a mathematical object which has both a magnitude (length) and a direction. Orientation is the angle between two vectors, or the direction in which a vector is pointing. It is important to note that orientation is relative, meaning that the angle between two vectors may be different depending on which vector is being used as a reference. Orientation can be used to describe the position of an object in space, and is often used in computer graphics and robotics.
