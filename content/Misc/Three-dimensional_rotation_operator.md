# Three-dimensional rotation operator

A three-dimensional rotation operator is a mathematical operation that rotates a 3D object in a specific direction. It is used to change the orientation of an object in 3D space. The operator is represented by a 3x3 matrix which contains three angles that define the direction and amount of rotation. The operator is applied to the object's coordinates to rotate the object in the desired direction. The three angles are known as Euler angles and are usually measured in degrees. The three angles are yaw, pitch, and roll. Yaw is the rotation about the vertical axis, pitch is the rotation about the horizontal axis, and roll is the rotation about the depth axis. The three-dimensional rotation operator is used in many applications such as computer graphics, robotics, navigation, and virtual reality.
