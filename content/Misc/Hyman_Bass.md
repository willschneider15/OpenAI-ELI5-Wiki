# Hyman Bass

Hyman Bass is a mathematical concept that explains how two groups of people can come together and form a larger group. It is based on the idea that each group has a unique set of characteristics and that when combined, these characteristics can create a larger, stronger group.

Hyman Bass states that when two groups come together, they can form a new group that is stronger than either group was on its own. This is because each group has its own strengths and weaknesses, and when they come together, they can use their strengths to make up for each other's weaknesses.
