# Erland Samuel Bring

Erland Samuel Bring was a Swedish economist who proposed the concept of "time-dividing" in the early 1900s. This concept suggests that when making decisions, people should consider the future consequences of their current actions. This means looking at the long-term effects of a decision, rather than just the immediate outcome.

To explain it in simpler terms, Erland Samuel Bring proposed that people should think about how their current decisions will affect them in the future. This means that when making a decision, people should consider how it will affect them in the long-term, rather than just the immediate outcome. For example, if someone is deciding whether to buy something, they should consider how it will affect their finances in the future, rather than just the immediate gratification of buying it.
