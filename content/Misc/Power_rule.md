# Power rule

Power Rule is a rule used in calculus to find the derivatives of functions. It states that the derivative of a function with a variable exponent is equal to the exponent multiplied by the function with a variable exponent with its exponent decreased by one. For example, if you have a function f(x) = x^3, then the derivative of this function using the power rule would be f'(x) = 3x^2. 

This rule is useful because it allows us to quickly and easily calculate the derivatives of functions with variable exponents. It is also important to remember that the power rule only applies to functions with variable exponents, not constants. For example, if you have a function f(x) = 5x^3, then the derivative of this function would not be equal to 5x^2, but rather 15x^2.
