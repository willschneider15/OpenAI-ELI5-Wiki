# Independent equation

An independent equation is an equation that can be solved without the help of any other equation. This means that the equation can be solved on its own, without the need to refer to any other equations. This type of equation is useful in mathematics, as it allows for the solution of a single equation without having to solve multiple equations at once. Independent equations are also useful in engineering and physics, as they allow for the solution of a single problem without the need to consider multiple factors.
