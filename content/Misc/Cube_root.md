# Cube root

Cube root is a type of mathematical operation that takes a number and returns the number that, when multiplied by itself three times, produces the original number. For example, the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. 

Cube root can also be used to find the length of an edge of a cube when the volume is known. The cube root of a number is the same as taking the number to the 1/3rd power. To calculate the cube root of a number, you can use the exponent operator (^) and raise the number to the power of 1/3. 

Cube root is a useful tool for finding the volume of a cube when the length of the edges is unknown. The formula for finding the volume of a cube is V = a^3, where a is the length of the edges. Therefore, to find the length of the edges, you can take the cube root of the volume. 

Cube root can also be used to solve equations that involve cubes. For instance, if an equation contains a cube of x, you can take the cube root of both sides of the equation to solve for x.
