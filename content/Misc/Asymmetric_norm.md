# Asymmetric norm

Asymmetric norm is a type of norm that values one outcome or result more than another. It is commonly used in decision-making and problem-solving, where one outcome is preferred over another, such as when choosing between two options. This type of norm allows for a more flexible approach to decision-making, as it allows for different levels of preference for different outcomes. For example, one outcome may be preferred over another, but the preference might not be as strong as when using a symmetric norm. Asymmetric norms can also be used to prioritize certain outcomes over others, such as when making a decision between two options that have different levels of importance. Asymmetric norms can be used to make decisions more efficiently and can be beneficial in situations where a clear preference for one outcome over another is needed.
