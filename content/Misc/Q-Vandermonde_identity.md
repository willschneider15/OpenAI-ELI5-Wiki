# Q-Vandermonde identity

The Q-Vandermonde identity is a mathematical formula that can be used to calculate the sum of products of two sets of numbers. It is named after the mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who first discovered it.

The formula is written as:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} \prod_{j=0}^{i} q_j = \prod_{j=0}^{n} (1 + q_j)$$

In this formula, the $q_j$ are the elements of the first set of numbers, and the $n$ is the total number of elements in the set. The formula states that the sum of the products of the elements of the first set is equal to the product of the elements of the second set, plus one.

This formula can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the sum of a series of numbers, or determining the probability of a certain event happening. It is a useful tool for mathematicians, and can be used to solve a variety of problems.
