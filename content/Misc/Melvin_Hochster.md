# Melvin Hochster

Melvin Hochster is a mathematician who developed the concept of "Hochster's Formula". This formula states that if two numbers are added together, then the result is equal to the sum of the two numbers. This means that if you add two numbers together, the result will be the same as if you had added the two numbers separately. This concept is important for mathematics because it allows us to solve equations and other problems more quickly and easily. Hochster's Formula is often used in algebra and calculus, as well as other areas of mathematics.
