# Isomorphism class

Isomorphism classes are groups of objects that have the same shape and structure, even though they may look different. For example, a cube and a pyramid are both 3-dimensional objects, so they are in the same isomorphism class. Isomorphism classes are an important concept in mathematics, because they allow us to classify objects and make it easier to study them. By grouping objects that have the same structure, we can better understand how they work and how they interact with each other.
