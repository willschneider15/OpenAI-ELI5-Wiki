# Commutation matrix

A commutation matrix is a type of matrix used in mathematics to show the relationship between two sets of variables. In particular, it shows how the order of operations affects the outcome. For example, if two numbers are multiplied in different orders, the result will be different. The commutation matrix is used to represent this relationship. It is a square matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the number of variables. Each row and column corresponds to one of the variables. The elements of the matrix are either 1 or 0. A 1 indicates that the order of the two variables affects the result, while a 0 indicates that the order does not matter. The commutation matrix is used in many different areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, graph theory, and probability.
