# Implicit function theorem

The Implicit Function Theorem states that if a function, f(x,y), is differentiable at a point (a,b) and the partial derivative of f with respect to y is not zero at (a,b), then there exists an open neighborhood around (a,b) and a function, g(x), such that f(x,g(x)) = 0 for all x in the open neighborhood. In other words, the Implicit Function Theorem states that if we have a function that is differentiable at a certain point and its partial derivative with respect to one variable is not zero, then we can find a function that will make the equation equal to zero.
