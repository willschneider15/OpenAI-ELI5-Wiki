# Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin

Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin was a French mathematician and educator who developed a new way of teaching mathematics. She believed that math should be taught in a way that was more interactive and engaging for students. She developed a method called the "Dubreil-Jacotin Method" which focused on problem solving, collaboration, and exploration. This method encouraged students to think critically, experiment with different strategies, and develop their own understanding of mathematics. Marie-Louise also believed that mathematics should be accessible to all students, regardless of their social or economic background. She believed that everyone should have the opportunity to learn and understand mathematics. She was a pioneer in mathematics education and her methods are still used today.
