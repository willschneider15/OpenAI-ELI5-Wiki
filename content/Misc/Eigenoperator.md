# Eigenoperator

An Eigenoperator is a mathematical concept that is used to describe how certain objects or systems will react to certain changes. It is based on the idea that when a change is made to a system, the system will behave in a predictable way. For example, if an object is rotated, it will always rotate in the same direction. This is because the object has an Eigenoperator, which is a mathematical description of the object's behavior. The Eigenoperator tells us how the object will react to changes, and it can be used to predict the behavior of the object in different situations.
