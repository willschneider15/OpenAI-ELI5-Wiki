# Cylinder (algebra)

A cylinder is a 3-dimensional shape that looks like a tube or a can. It has two circular ends and one curved side. 

The curved side of a cylinder is called the lateral surface. The two circular ends are called bases. The distance between the two bases is called the height of the cylinder. 

In algebra, the equation for a cylinder is: 

$$V = \pi r^2h$$

Where V is the volume of the cylinder, r is the radius of the cylinder, and h is the height of the cylinder. 

The surface area of a cylinder can be found using the equation: 

$$A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$$

Where A is the surface area of the cylinder, r is the radius of the cylinder, and h is the height of the cylinder. 

Cylinders are used in many everyday items, such as cans, pipes, and paper towel rolls.
