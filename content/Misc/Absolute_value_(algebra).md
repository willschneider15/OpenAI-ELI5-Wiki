# Absolute value (algebra)

Absolute value is a concept used in algebra to represent the magnitude or distance of a number from 0. It is denoted by a pair of vertical lines surrounding the number, as in |x|. This means that the absolute value of any number is always positive, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative. 

For example, the absolute value of -5 is 5, because -5 is 5 units away from 0 on the number line. Similarly, the absolute value of 5 is also 5, because 5 is 5 units away from 0 on the number line. 

The absolute value of a number can be used to measure the magnitude of a number, regardless of its sign. It can also be used to solve equations in which two numbers have different signs. For example, if x + 5 = -2, then the absolute value of x can be found by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, resulting in |x| = 7.
