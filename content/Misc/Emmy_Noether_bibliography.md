# Emmy Noether bibliography

Emmy Noether was a mathematician and physicist. She is best known for her contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. Her work has been credited with revolutionizing the field of mathematics, and her theorem is considered one of the most important theorems in mathematics. Noether's theorem states that for every symmetry in nature, there is a conservation law. This means that if something is conserved in nature, it must be related to some kind of symmetry. This is an important concept in physics, as it relates to the conservation of energy. Noether's work has been influential in the development of quantum mechanics and relativity. Her work has been recognized by many organizations, including the American Mathematical Society, which named her an honorary member in 1935. Today, her work is still being studied and her influence is still being felt in the world of mathematics and physics.
