# Boundedly generated group

A boundedly generated group is a group that can be generated by a finite number of elements. This means that the group is created by a finite set of elements, and the group is bounded because the number of elements is finite. Boundedly generated groups are useful for studying finite groups, since they can be studied in a more structured way. In addition, boundedly generated groups can provide insight into the structure of infinite groups, since they are related to infinite groups in certain ways. For example, if a boundedly generated group is a subgroup of an infinite group, then the structure of the boundedly generated group can be used to understand the structure of the infinite group.
