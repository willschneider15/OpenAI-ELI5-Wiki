# CSS code

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to style webpages by adding colors, fonts, spacing, and other design elements. CSS works by writing code that tells the web browser how to display the HTML elements on a page. The code tells the browser which colors to use, how big to make elements, where to place them on the page, and more. CSS is used to make webpages look more attractive and organized. It can also help make webpages easier to use and navigate. CSS is an important part of web design and can help make a website look professional and polished.
