# Cauchy sequence

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two numbers becomes increasingly small as the sequence progresses. In other words, the sequence converges to a certain value. For example, if the sequence is 1, 1.1, 1.11, 1.111, 1.1111, and so on, the difference between each number gets smaller and smaller, and the sequence converges to 1.1111. This sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
