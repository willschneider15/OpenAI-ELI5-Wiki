# Ore algebra

Ore algebra is a type of algebra that deals with equations involving variables, constants, and operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Ã˜ystein Ore.

In Ore algebra, equations are written in a special form which allows for the variables to be moved around and manipulated. For example, if we have an equation like `2x + 3y = 8`, we can use Ore algebra to rearrange it to `x = 4 - 3/2 y`.

Ore algebra is useful because it allows us to solve equations more quickly and easily than traditional algebra. It can also be used to solve equations with more than two variables, which would be difficult to do with traditional algebra.
