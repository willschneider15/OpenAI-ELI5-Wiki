# Alonâ€“Boppana bound

Alon-Boppana bound is a mathematical concept used to measure the performance of algorithms. It is a limit that describes how well an algorithm can perform on a particular problem. The bound states that if an algorithm is run on a graph with n nodes, the maximum number of edges it can find is 2*sqrt(n). This means that no matter how efficient the algorithm is, it will never be able to find more than 2*sqrt(n) edges. This bound can be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms, and can be used to determine which algorithm is best for a particular problem.
