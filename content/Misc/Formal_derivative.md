# Formal derivative

Formal derivatives are mathematical equations used to calculate the rate of change of a function with respect to one or more variables. They are used to measure how a function changes when its input values are changed. Formal derivatives are often used in calculus to solve problems involving motion, force, acceleration, and other physical phenomena. They can also be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a function, or to determine the slope of a graph. Formal derivatives are written using a special notation, which includes the use of symbols such as "d" and "âˆ‚". This notation is used to represent the derivative of a function with respect to one or more variables. Formal derivatives can be used to solve many complex problems, and can be used to make predictions about the behavior of certain functions.
