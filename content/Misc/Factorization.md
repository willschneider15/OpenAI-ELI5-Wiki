# Factorization

Factorization is a way of breaking down a number into its factors. Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to get the original number. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. By finding the factors of a number, you can quickly solve equations and find out the number's prime factors. Prime factors are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and 1. Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime factors of a number.
