# Nonnegative rank (linear algebra)

Nonnegative rank is a type of rank used in linear algebra. It is a measure of the number of linearly independent columns or rows in a matrix. A matrix has a nonnegative rank if all of its entries are nonnegative numbers. The nonnegative rank is always less than or equal to the regular rank of the matrix. For example, if a matrix has a regular rank of 4, then its nonnegative rank is also 4. The nonnegative rank is important for linear programming, as it helps to identify the number of constraints needed to solve a problem.
