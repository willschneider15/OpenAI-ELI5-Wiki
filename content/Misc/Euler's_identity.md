# Euler's identity

Euler's identity is a famous equation that links together some of the most important numbers in mathematics. It states that e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0, where e is Euler's number (2.71828...), i is the imaginary number (the square root of -1), and pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (3.14159...). This equation is important because it shows how these three seemingly unrelated numbers are connected. It also shows how mathematics can be used to solve complex problems and make sense of the world.
