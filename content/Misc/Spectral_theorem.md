# Spectral theorem

The Spectral Theorem is a powerful tool for understanding linear transformations. In simple terms, it states that if you have a linear transformation (also called a matrix) then you can decompose it into a series of simpler transformations. This decomposition is called a spectral decomposition, and it can be used to understand the properties of the original transformation.

For example, if you have a matrix A, then the Spectral Theorem states that you can decompose it into a series of simpler transformations. This decomposition is made up of a set of eigenvectors (vectors that do not change when multiplied by the matrix) and their corresponding eigenvalues (scalar values associated with each eigenvector). The eigenvectors and eigenvalues together tell us a lot about the properties of the matrix A, such as its stability, its range, and its rank. 

In summary, the Spectral Theorem is a way of understanding linear transformations by decomposing them into simpler transformations. This decomposition allows us to gain insights into the properties of the original transformation and make predictions about how it will behave.
