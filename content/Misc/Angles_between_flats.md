# Angles between flats

Angles between flats is a concept used in the design of buildings, specifically in the arrangement of the floors. It is a way of ensuring that the building has a good balance between the amount of sunlight and ventilation it receives.

The angles between flats refer to the angles between the walls of two adjacent flats. Generally, the angles should be between 90 and 120 degrees, which allows for the most natural sunlight and ventilation. This angle also ensures that the flats are not too close together, which can lead to overcrowding.

The angles between flats are an important consideration for architects and designers when designing a building. It is important to ensure that the angles are just right, as it can affect the overall comfort and livability of the building. The angles should also be taken into consideration when designing the interior of the flats, as they can have an effect on the amount of natural light and ventilation that the flats receive.
