# Suspension of a ring

Suspension of a ring is a physics concept that explains how a ring can be suspended in mid-air. It is achieved by using a combination of two forces, tension and gravity. 

Tension is the force that is created by the rope or string that is holding the ring up. This force is equal to the weight of the ring, so the rope must be able to support the weight of the ring.

Gravity is the force that pulls the ring down. This force must be counteracted by the tension of the rope, so the rope must be strong enough to keep the ring suspended in mid-air.

The two forces work together to keep the ring in a state of equilibrium, where the tension and the gravity are equal. This allows the ring to stay suspended in mid-air without falling.
