# Differentiation rules

Differentiation rules are a set of mathematical rules that allow us to calculate the derivative of a given function. The derivative of a function is a measure of how the function changes as the independent variable changes. Differentiation rules allow us to calculate the derivative of a function without having to solve a complicated equation. 

The most commonly used differentiation rules are the power rule, the product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. The power rule states that the derivative of a function raised to a power is equal to the power multiplied by the function raised to the power minus one. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is equal to the first function multiplied by the derivative of the second function plus the derivative of the first function multiplied by the second function. The quotient rule states that the derivative of a fraction is equal to the denominator multiplied by the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator multiplied by the derivative of the denominator all divided by the square of the denominator. Lastly, the chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is equal to the derivative of the inner function multiplied by the derivative of the outer function.
