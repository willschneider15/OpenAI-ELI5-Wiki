# Cauchy–Schwarz inequality

The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is a mathematical statement that says that if you have two numbers, then the product of those two numbers will always be less than or equal to the square of the bigger number. This is like saying that if you have two pieces of candy, then the total number of pieces of candy will always be less than or equal to the number of pieces in the bigger pile. For example, if you have 3 pieces of candy and 4 pieces of candy, then the total number of pieces of candy will never be more than 4², which is 16.
