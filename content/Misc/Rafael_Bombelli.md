# Rafael Bombelli

Rafael Bombelli was an Italian mathematician who lived in the 16th century. He is known for his work in algebra, which is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols to represent numbers and operations.

Bombelli was the first to develop a method for solving cubic equations, which are equations with three unknowns. He was also the first to use complex numbers, which are numbers that include a real and an imaginary part.

Bombelli's work was very important in the development of modern algebra. He showed that equations could be solved using a combination of arithmetic and geometry, which is now known as algebraic geometry. He also developed new methods for solving equations that are still used today.

Bombelli's work helped to make mathematics more accessible and understandable to the average person. He is remembered as a great mathematician who helped to revolutionize the field of algebra.
