# Variable (mathematics)

A variable is a mathematical symbol used to represent a number or quantity that can change. Variables are typically used to represent unknown values, such as the result of a mathematical equation. For example, when solving a quadratic equation, the variable x is used to represent the unknown solution. Variables can also be used to represent data in graphs and tables. For example, a graph may use the variable x to represent the number of items sold, and the variable y to represent the total revenue. Variables can also be used to represent functions, which are equations that describe relationships between two or more variables. For example, a function may use the variables x and y to describe the relationship between the number of items sold and the total revenue.
