# Pokhozhaev's identity

Pokhozhaev's identity is a mathematical theorem that relates the solution of a certain type of partial differential equation to the volume of the domain on which the equation is defined. It states that if a certain type of partial differential equation has a solution, then the product of the solution and the volume of the domain must be equal to a certain constant. This constant is known as the Pokhozhaev invariant. 

In essence, Pokhozhaev's identity tells us that the solution of a partial differential equation is related to the size of the domain on which the equation is defined. This theorem is useful for understanding the behavior of solutions of certain equations and can be used to determine the size of a domain for which a certain equation has a solution.
