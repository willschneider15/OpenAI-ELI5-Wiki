# Inequality (mathematics)

Inequality is a concept in mathematics that describes the relationship between two values. It is used to compare two quantities and determine if one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. 

Inequalities are expressed using symbols such as greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (â‰¥), and less than or equal to (â‰¤). These symbols are placed between two values to indicate the relationship between them. For example, if x is greater than y, the inequality would be written as x > y.

Inequalities can also be used to describe a range of values, such as x > 5 and x < 10. This means that x is greater than 5 and less than 10. 

Inequalities can be used to solve a variety of problems, including finding the area of a shape, calculating the probability of an event, and determining the maximum or minimum value of a function. They are an important part of mathematics and are used in many areas of life.
