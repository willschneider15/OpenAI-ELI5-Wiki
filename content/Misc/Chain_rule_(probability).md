# Chain rule (probability)

The chain rule in probability is a rule that allows us to calculate the probability of multiple events occurring in a sequence. This rule states that the overall probability of all events occurring is the product of the individual probabilities of each event occurring. For example, if we are trying to calculate the probability of flipping a coin and rolling a die, we would calculate the probability of flipping a head and rolling a 6 as the product of the probability of flipping a head (1/2) and the probability of rolling a 6 (1/6). This would give us an overall probability of 1/12. The chain rule is useful in helping us calculate the probability of multiple events occurring in a sequence.
