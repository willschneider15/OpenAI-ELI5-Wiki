# Roger Wolcott Richardson

Roger Wolcott Richardson was a scientist who developed a mathematical concept known as Richardson Extrapolation. This method is used to estimate the value of a function at a certain point, even when only a limited amount of data is available. 

It works by taking two sets of data points, one with a larger number of points and one with a smaller number of points. The extrapolation then uses the larger set of points to guess the value of the function at the point given by the smaller set of points. 

Richardson's extrapolation is particularly useful when only a limited amount of data is available, as it can be used to make more accurate predictions than would be possible with just the limited data. This makes it a valuable tool in many scientific fields, such as engineering, economics, and physics.
