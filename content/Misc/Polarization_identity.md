# Polarization identity

Polarization identity is an important concept in physics. It is based on the idea that a system's total polarization (the net charge of its particles) is equal to the sum of its individual polarizations. This means that if a system has two particles with opposite charges, then the net charge of the system is zero. This identity is useful in understanding the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, as well as the behavior of matter and energy in various systems. In addition, it can be used to calculate the electric field generated by a given system.
