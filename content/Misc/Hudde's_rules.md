# Hudde's rules

Hudde's Rules are a set of guidelines used to help children understand the basics of money and how to manage it. They were created by Dutch-born banker and philanthropist Jan de Witt Hudde in the 1600s. 

The rules are simple and easy to remember:

1. Spend less than you earn.
2. Save a portion of what you earn.
3. Don't borrow money unless you are sure you can pay it back.
4. Don't buy something unless you can afford it.
5. Don't waste money.

These rules are important for children to learn because they teach them the basics of financial responsibility, such as budgeting, saving, and avoiding debt. By following these rules, children can develop good money habits that will help them throughout their lives.
