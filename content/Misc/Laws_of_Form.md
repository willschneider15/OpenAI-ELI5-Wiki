# Laws of Form

Laws of Form is a mathematical system developed by George Spencer-Brown in 1969. It is a set of rules that describe how to use symbols to represent and manipulate information. The system is based on the idea of "distinction" - the ability to distinguish between two things. The basic idea is that by making distinctions between things, we can create a structure that can be used to represent information. This structure can then be used to solve problems and develop theories. The system uses a single symbol, the "mark", to represent the distinction between two things. The mark is then used to create a set of equations that can be used to solve problems. Laws of Form is a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating information, and can be used to analyze complex systems.
