# Graph dynamical system

A Graph Dynamical System (GDS) is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system over time. It is used to study how different elements of a system interact and change over time. GDSs are useful for understanding complex systems, such as social networks, ecosystems, and financial markets. In a GDS, a graph is used to represent the system, with nodes representing the elements and edges representing the interactions between them. The dynamics of the system are then described by a set of equations that determine how the elements interact and change over time. By studying the GDS, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of the system, such as how it reacts to external influences, how it evolves over time, and how different elements influence each other.
