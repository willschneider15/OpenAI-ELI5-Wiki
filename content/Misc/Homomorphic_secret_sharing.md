# Homomorphic secret sharing

Homomorphic secret sharing is a technique used to securely store information. It works by splitting a secret into multiple pieces, or "shares", and distributing them among multiple people. Each share is encrypted so that no one person can access the secret. However, when the shares are combined, the secret can be decrypted and accessed. This allows for secure storage of the secret without any single person having access to the entire secret. This makes it much more difficult for someone to steal or misuse the secret.
