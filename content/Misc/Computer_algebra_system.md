# Computer algebra system

A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that helps solve mathematical problems. It can do calculations, solve equations, plot graphs, and simplify expressions. CAS can be used to solve complex equations, such as those involving calculus, quickly and accurately. It can also be used to simplify expressions, making them easier to understand and work with. CAS can be used in many different fields, such as engineering, physics, and finance. It is an invaluable tool for those who need to solve difficult problems quickly and accurately.
