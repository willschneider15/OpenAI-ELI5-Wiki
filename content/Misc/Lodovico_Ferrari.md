# Lodovico Ferrari

Lodovico Ferrari was an Italian mathematician who lived in the 16th century. He is best known for discovering a way to solve the cubic equation, which is a type of mathematical equation that involves three variables. Ferrari's method involved using a combination of algebraic and geometric techniques to solve the equation. This was a major breakthrough in mathematics, as it allowed mathematicians to solve equations that had previously been unsolvable. Ferrari's work is still used today in mathematics, and it has had a lasting impact on the field.
