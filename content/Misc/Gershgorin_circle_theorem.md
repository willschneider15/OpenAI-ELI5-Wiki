# Gershgorin circle theorem

Gershgorin circle theorem is a way to find the eigenvalues (values of a matrix that represent its shape) of a matrix. It states that all the eigenvalues of a matrix lie within a certain number of circles. Each circle is centered at a point on the matrix and its radius is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the same row of the matrix. By drawing the circles, you can see which eigenvalues lie within them, and this can help you figure out the eigenvalues of the matrix.
