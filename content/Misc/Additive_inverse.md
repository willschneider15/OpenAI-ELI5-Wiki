# Additive inverse

Additive inverse is a mathematical concept that states that for any number, there is an opposite number that when added together will equal zero. For example, the additive inverse of 5 is -5 because when 5 and -5 are added together the result is 0. 

The concept of additive inverse is used in many mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In addition, the concept is used in algebra when solving equations. 

Additive inverse is also known as the opposite of a number. For example, the opposite of 5 is -5. This means that when 5 and -5 are added together, the result is 0. 

Additive inverse is an important concept in mathematics as it helps us to solve equations and understand the relationship between numbers. It can also help us to understand how numbers interact with each other.
