# Operand

An operand is a quantity used in an operation, such as a mathematical equation or a computer program. It is typically a value or variable that is being acted upon by an operator. For example, in the equation "2 + 3 = 5", the numbers 2 and 3 are the operands, and the + sign is the operator. In a computer program, operands may be numbers, variables, or other data. They are the objects of the program's instructions, and the instructions are the operators that act upon them. Operands are essential for any type of operation, as they provide the values that the operator acts upon.
