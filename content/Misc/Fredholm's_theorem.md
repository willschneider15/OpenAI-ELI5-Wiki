# Fredholm's theorem

Fredholm's theorem states that the solution to a certain type of equation can be found by adding a few extra terms. This theorem is used in mathematics and physics to solve problems involving linear equations.

In the simplest terms, Fredholm's theorem states that if you have an equation with a few unknowns (variables) and you can't solve it, then you can add a few extra terms to the equation and then it can be solved. 

For example, if you have an equation with three unknowns and you can't solve it, then you can add a few extra terms to the equation and then it can be solved. This is because the extra terms can be used to make the equation easier to solve. 

In conclusion, Fredholm's theorem states that if you have an equation with a few unknowns, then you can add a few extra terms to the equation to make it easier to solve. This theorem is used in mathematics and physics to solve problems involving linear equations.
