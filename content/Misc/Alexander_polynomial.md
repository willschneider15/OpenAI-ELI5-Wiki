# Alexander polynomial

The Alexander polynomial is a mathematical tool used to study knots. A knot is a loop of rope tied in a certain way. The Alexander polynomial helps us understand how a knot is tied and what properties it has. 

The Alexander polynomial assigns a numerical value to a knot. This value can be used to determine if two knots are the same or different. It can also tell us if a knot is unknot, which means it can be untied. 

The Alexander polynomial is named after the mathematician James Waddell Alexander II. He developed the polynomial in the 1920s to study knots. It is still used today by mathematicians and scientists to study knots and their properties.
