# Carlitz–Wan conjecture

The Carlitz–Wan conjecture is an idea about how prime numbers work. Prime numbers are special numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one. The Carlitz–Wan conjecture states that if you add up all the prime numbers up to a certain number, the result will always be greater than the number itself. For example, if you add up all the prime numbers up to 10, the result will be greater than 10. This conjecture has been proven for some numbers, but not all.
