# Michel Kervaire

Michel Kervaire was a French mathematician who made important contributions to topology and algebra. He is best known for his work on the Kervaire invariant, which is a mathematical invariant used to classify high-dimensional spheres. The Kervaire invariant is a number that can be used to determine whether two spheres of the same dimension are the same or not. It is an important part of topology, which is the study of shapes and spaces. Kervaire's work on the Kervaire invariant was groundbreaking, and it has been used by mathematicians and scientists ever since.
