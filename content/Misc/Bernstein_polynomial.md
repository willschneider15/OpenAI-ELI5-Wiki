# Bernstein polynomial

Bernstein polynomials are mathematical functions that help us to approximate curves and surfaces. They are named after Sergei Bernstein, who developed them in 1912. Bernstein polynomials are used in computer graphics and animation to create smooth and realistic curves. They are also used in engineering and physics to model physical systems.

Bernstein polynomials work by taking a set of points and connecting them with a smooth curve. Each point is connected to the next with a polynomial equation. This equation is then used to create a smooth curve that follows the points. The resulting curve is a smooth and realistic representation of the points.
