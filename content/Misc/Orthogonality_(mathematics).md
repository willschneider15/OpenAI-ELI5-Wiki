# Orthogonality (mathematics)

Orthogonality is a mathematical concept that describes when two lines, vectors, or planes are at right angles to each other. It is also known as perpendicularity. This concept is important in many areas of mathematics, including geometry, linear algebra, and calculus.

In geometry, two lines are said to be orthogonal if they intersect at a right angle. A vector is orthogonal to another vector if the two vectors are at a right angle when drawn on a graph. In linear algebra, two vectors are said to be orthogonal if their dot product is equal to zero.

In calculus, two curves are said to be orthogonal if they intersect at right angles. Orthogonality can also be used to describe the relationship between two functions. If the two functions are orthogonal, then their derivatives will be at right angles when plotted on a graph.

In summary, orthogonality is a concept that describes when two lines, vectors, or planes are at right angles to each other. This concept is used in many areas of mathematics, including geometry, linear algebra, and calculus.
