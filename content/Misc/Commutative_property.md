# Commutative property

The commutative property is a mathematical property that states that the order of two numbers or variables does not matter when performing an operation. For example, if you are adding two numbers, the result will be the same regardless of which number is first.

For example, if you are adding the numbers 5 and 3, the result will be 8 regardless of the order of the numbers.

5 + 3 = 8 
3 + 5 = 8 

The commutative property also applies to multiplication. For example, if you are multiplying the numbers 2 and 4, the result will be 8 regardless of the order of the numbers.

2 x 4 = 8 
4 x 2 = 8 

The commutative property is an important concept to understand when working with numbers and variables. Knowing this property can help you solve problems quickly and accurately.
