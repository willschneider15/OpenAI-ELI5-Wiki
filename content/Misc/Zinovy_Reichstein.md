# Zinovy Reichstein

Zinovy Reichstein was a Russian mathematician who developed the concept of partial derivatives. Partial derivatives are a way of measuring how a function changes when one of its variables changes. For example, if a function is dependent on two variables, like x and y, a partial derivative would measure how the function changes when only x changes, while keeping y constant. Partial derivatives help us understand how a function behaves when it is changing over time. They are especially useful in calculus, physics, and engineering.
