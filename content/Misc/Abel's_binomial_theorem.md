# Abel's binomial theorem

Abel's binomial theorem is a mathematical theorem that states that when a number is raised to a certain power, the result can be expressed as a sum of powers of the number. For example, if a number is raised to the third power (x^3), then the result can be expressed as x^3 + x^2 + x^1 + x^0. This theorem is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. 

The theorem is particularly useful for simplifying algebraic equations, as it allows for the expansion of powers of a number into a sum. This makes it easier to solve equations that involve powers of a number. For example, if an equation contains (x + 2)^3, then Abel's binomial theorem can be used to expand the equation into x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 8, which can then be solved more easily.
