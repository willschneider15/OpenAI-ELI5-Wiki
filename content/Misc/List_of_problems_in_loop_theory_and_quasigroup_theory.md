# List of problems in loop theory and quasigroup theory

Loop theory and quasigroup theory are two areas of mathematics which study the properties of certain mathematical structures. In both theories, a list of problems is a set of mathematical problems that are related to the underlying structure being studied. For example, in loop theory, the list of problems might include questions about the properties of loops, such as the existence of certain types of loops, or the structure of loops under certain operations. Similarly, in quasigroup theory, the list of problems might include questions about the properties of quasigroups, such as the existence of certain types of quasigroups, or the structure of quasigroups under certain operations. By studying these lists of problems, mathematicians can gain insight into the underlying structures being studied and develop new mathematical results.
