# Linear subspace

A linear subspace is a set of vectors that form a space when combined. In other words, it's a collection of points, lines, planes, or any combination of them in a single space. All the vectors in a linear subspace must satisfy certain conditions - they must be able to be added together and multiplied by scalars. This means that all the vectors in a linear subspace must be linearly dependent, meaning that the sum of the vectors must equal zero. Linear subspaces are important in mathematics because they can be used to describe a wide range of shapes and objects.
