# Resolvent cubic

Resolvent cubics are equations that have three unknown variables and can be used to solve certain types of problems. They are made up of three terms, each of which contains one of the unknown variables. Each term is then multiplied together to form the equation. The equation can then be solved by using the quadratic formula to find the values of the unknown variables. The solution of the equation can then be used to find the answer to the problem. Resolvent cubics are useful for solving problems related to geometry, algebra, and calculus.
