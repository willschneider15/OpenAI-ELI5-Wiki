# Distributive property

The distributive property is a mathematical concept that states that when you multiply a number by a group of numbers that are added together, it is the same as multiplying each number in the group by the original number and then adding the products together. 

For example, if you have 3 + 4, and you want to multiply it by 2, then you can use the distributive property to solve the equation. Instead of multiplying 3 and 4 by 2, you would multiply 2 by 3 and 2 by 4, and then add the products together. So, 2(3 + 4) = 2 x 3 + 2 x 4 = 6 + 8 = 14. 

The distributive property is used to simplify equations and make them easier to solve. It can also be used to solve equations with more than two numbers. For example, if you have 3 + 4 + 5, and you want to multiply it by 2, then you would use the distributive property to solve the equation. Instead of multiplying 3, 4 and 5 by 2, you would multiply 2 by 3, 2 by 4, and 2 by 5, and then add the products together. So, 2(3 + 4 + 5) = 2 x 3
