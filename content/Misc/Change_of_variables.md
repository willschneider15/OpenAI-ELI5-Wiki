# Change of variables

Change of variables is a mathematical technique used to simplify a problem by changing the variables that are used to represent the problem. It involves substituting one set of variables with another set of variables, while maintaining the same problem. This can be done by using a transformation, such as a substitution, scaling, rotation, or reflection.

Change of variables can be used to solve many types of problems, such as calculus and linear algebra. In calculus, changing the variable of integration can make it easier to evaluate a definite integral. In linear algebra, changing the variable of a system of linear equations can make it easier to solve for the unknowns.

Change of variables is also used to reduce the complexity of a problem. By changing the variables, the number of terms or operations can be reduced, which can make it easier to solve the problem.

Change of variables can also be used to solve problems that are difficult to solve using the original variables. By changing the variables, the problem can be transformed into a simpler form, which can then be solved more easily.
