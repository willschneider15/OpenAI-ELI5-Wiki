# Ezra Brown

Ezra Brown is a concept that encourages us to take ownership of our own learning. It encourages us to be curious and explore the world around us, to ask questions and seek out answers. It also encourages us to take risks and try new things, to make mistakes and learn from them. The idea is that the more we learn and explore, the more confident and capable we become. It's a way of approaching learning that encourages us to take control of our own learning and to be proactive in our growth and development.
