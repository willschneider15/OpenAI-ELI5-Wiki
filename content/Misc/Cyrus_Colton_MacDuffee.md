# Cyrus Colton MacDuffee

Cyrus Colton MacDuffee was a famous American psychologist who developed the concept of "self-actualization". This concept suggests that people have an innate need to reach their full potential, and that they can do so by understanding and fulfilling their individual needs. MacDuffee believed that people could reach self-actualization by finding their true purpose in life, and by developing their own unique talents and abilities. MacDuffee's theory also suggests that people should strive to reach their full potential in all areas of their life, including physical, mental, and spiritual growth. By doing so, individuals can develop a sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction in life.
