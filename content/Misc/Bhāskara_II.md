# Bhāskara II

Bhāskara II was a mathematician and astronomer from the 12th century who made important contributions to math and astronomy. He is most famous for his work on the quadratic equation, which is an equation with two unknowns (x and y). Bhāskara II developed a method to solve these equations, which is now known as the "Bhāskara II Method". This method involves factoring the equation into two parts, and then solving each part separately. The Bhāskara II Method is still used today to solve quadratic equations and is considered one of the most important mathematical discoveries of all time. It is also used in many other areas, such as calculus and physics. Bhāskara II's work has had a lasting impact on mathematics and science, and is still used by students and professionals today.
