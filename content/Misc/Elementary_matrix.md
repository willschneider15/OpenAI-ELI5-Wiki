# Elementary matrix

An elementary matrix is a matrix that is obtained from an identity matrix by performing a single row operation. Row operations include swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a multiple of one row to another. Elementary matrices are used in matrix algebra to simplify solutions to linear equations. They are also used to find the inverse of a matrix, which is useful for solving systems of linear equations. Elementary matrices are important in linear algebra because they allow us to easily perform row operations and simplify solutions.
