# Hermite's identity

Hermite's identity is a mathematical equation that states the sum of two matrices multiplied together is equal to the trace of the product of the matrices. The equation is named after Charles Hermite, a French mathematician who discovered it in 1855.

In simpler terms, it is a way to calculate the sum of two matrices without actually multiplying them together. Instead, you take the trace of the product of the matrices, which is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. This is much faster and easier than multiplying two matrices together.

In conclusion, Hermite's identity is a mathematical equation that states the sum of two matrices multiplied together is equal to the trace of the product of the matrices. This equation is useful for quickly calculating the sum of two matrices without having to actually multiply them together.
