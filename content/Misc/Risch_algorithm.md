# Risch algorithm

The Risch algorithm is a mathematical tool used to solve certain types of integrals. It is a way of breaking down the integral into simpler pieces that can be more easily solved. The algorithm works by dividing the integral into simpler parts, then applying special rules to each part to determine if the integral can be solved by a simple formula or if more complicated methods are needed. The Risch algorithm is a powerful tool for solving integrals, and is used in many areas of mathematics.
