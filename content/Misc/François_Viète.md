# François Viète

François Viète was a French mathematician who lived in the 16th century. He is best known for his work in algebra, which he used to solve problems in mathematics. He developed a new way of writing equations, called the "Viète Form," which uses letters to represent unknowns in equations. This form of algebra is still used today.

Viète was also the first to use letters to represent numbers in equations, which made it much easier to solve complex problems. He also developed a method for solving equations called the "Viète Method," which involves substituting letters for numbers in equations and then solving the equations.

Viète's work was revolutionary for its time and laid the groundwork for modern algebra. His work has been studied and used by mathematicians for centuries and is still relevant today.
