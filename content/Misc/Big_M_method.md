# Big M method

Big M method is an optimization technique used in linear programming to solve a problem with multiple constraints. It works by introducing a “big M” value into the objective function, which is a large number that forces the solution to meet the constraints of the problem. The value of M can be adjusted to ensure that the solution meets the desired criteria and constraints. Big M method is used in many fields, such as economics, engineering, and operations research. It is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and can be used to create optimal solutions to problems with multiple constraints.
