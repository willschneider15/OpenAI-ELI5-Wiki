# Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms

F4 and F5 algorithms are two algorithms created by Jean-Charles Faugère to solve polynomial systems. They are used to compute Gröbner bases, which are collections of polynomials that can be used to solve a polynomial system. F4 is an algorithm that uses Buchberger's criterion to reduce the number of polynomials in a Gröbner basis. F5 is an extension of F4 that uses a different strategy to reduce the size of the Gröbner basis. Both algorithms are efficient and have been used in many areas, such as cryptography and computer algebra systems.
