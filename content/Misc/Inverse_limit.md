# Inverse limit

Inverse limit is a concept used in mathematics to describe the relationship between two sets of variables. It is used when one set of variables is related to another set of variables in a way that is inverse to the relationship between the two sets. For example, if one set of variables is increasing while the other set of variables is decreasing, then the inverse limit of the two sets of variables is the point where the two sets intersect. Inverse limit is used to determine the maximum or minimum value of a set of variables and can be used to solve complex equations.
