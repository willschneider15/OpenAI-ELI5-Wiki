# Abel's identity

Abel's Identity is a mathematical equation named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel. It states that the sum of a series of terms, each of which is the product of a function and its derivative, is equal to zero. This equation can be used to solve problems involving the integration of functions, which is a process of finding the area under a curve. Abel's Identity is important in calculus because it allows mathematicians to solve problems that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to solve. It is also useful in physics, where it can be used to understand the behavior of particles.
