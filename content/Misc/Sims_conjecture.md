# Sims conjecture

Sims' Conjecture is a mathematical statement about the structure of certain groups. It states that if a group has an element of order two (an element whose square is the identity element), then the group is solvable. Solvable means that the group can be broken down into simpler pieces, and it is easier to study. This idea is useful in group theory, as it can help us understand how groups work.
