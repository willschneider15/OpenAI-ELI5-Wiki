# Schur complement

Schur complement is a way of simplifying a matrix. It works by removing a block of rows and columns from the original matrix and replacing them with an expression that describes the relationship between the remaining rows and columns. This is useful because it can reduce the size of the matrix, making it easier to work with and analyze. In addition, the Schur complement can also be used to solve linear equations and systems of equations. It is a useful tool for mathematicians and scientists who need to solve complex problems.
