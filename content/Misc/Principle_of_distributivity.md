# Principle of distributivity

The Principle of Distributivity states that multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each addend by the number and then adding the products. This concept can be written mathematically as: 

a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)

This principle is used in many areas of mathematics, including algebra and arithmetic. It is especially useful for simplifying equations and solving problems. For example, if you want to find the product of 3 and the sum of 4 and 5, the Principle of Distributivity allows you to calculate 3 * (4 + 5) as (3 * 4) + (3 * 5), which is 12 + 15 = 27. 

The Principle of Distributivity is also related to the commutative and associative properties of multiplication. The commutative property states that the order of the factors does not affect the product, while the associative property states that the grouping of the factors does not affect the product. Both of these properties can be used in combination with the distributive property to simplify equations and solve problems.
