# Rayleigh quotient

Rayleigh quotient is a mathematical tool used to find the eigenvalues of a matrix. It works by taking the ratio of the dot product of a matrix and a vector and the dot product of the vector and itself. The result of this ratio is the eigenvalue of the matrix. This method is useful because it is relatively simple and can be used to quickly calculate the eigenvalues of any matrix. It is also useful for determining the stability and accuracy of numerical algorithms.
