# Timeline of algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and equations to represent and solve problems. The timeline of algebra is a historical overview of the development of algebraic concepts and techniques throughout history. It begins with the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, who used basic algebraic equations to solve problems. It then moves to the Greeks, who developed more advanced methods of solving equations. In the Middle Ages, Islamic mathematicians made great strides in algebra, introducing new methods of solving equations and introducing the concept of algebraic notation. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European mathematicians built on the work of their predecessors, creating the modern algebraic system. Today, algebra is used in a variety of fields, from economics to engineering.
