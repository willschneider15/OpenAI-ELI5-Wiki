# Stephen Schanuel

Stephen Schanuel is a philosopher who proposed the idea of "implicit understanding". Implicit understanding is the idea that we can understand things without having to consciously think about them. It's like a "sixth sense" that allows us to understand things without having to explicitly spell them out. For example, when you are talking to someone, you may be able to understand what they are saying without having to explicitly ask them what they mean. This is because you have an implicit understanding of the context and the language they are using.
