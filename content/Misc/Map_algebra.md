# Map algebra

Map algebra is a way of combining different layers of geographic data to create new layers of data. It's like a math equation, but instead of using numbers, it uses geographic data. For example, you can use map algebra to combine two different layers of data - one showing the population of a city, and the other showing the average income of that city - to create a new layer of data showing the average income per person. Map algebra is a powerful tool that helps us to understand relationships between different types of data and make decisions based on this information.
