# Noether identities

Noether identities are mathematical relationships that are related to symmetries of physical systems. They were discovered by the German mathematician, Emmy Noether, and are used to describe the behavior of systems that have certain symmetries. Noether identities are used to show how certain quantities, such as energy and momentum, are conserved when the system is subject to certain symmetries. For example, if a system is invariant under rotations, then Noether's theorem states that the total angular momentum of the system must be conserved. This means that the amount of angular momentum in the system cannot change, no matter what happens to it. Noether identities can also be used to describe the behavior of more complex systems, such as those involving multiple particles or fields.
