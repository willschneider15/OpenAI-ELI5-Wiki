# Kernel (algebra)

Kernel is a concept in algebra that describes the core of a given set of equations. It is the set of all solutions that satisfy the equations. It is like a collection of answers that all work for the equations. 

For example, if you have the equation x + y = 7, the kernel of this equation is the set of all possible solutions that satisfy the equation. This set includes (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), and so on. All of these solutions are part of the kernel of this equation. 

In other words, the kernel is the set of all solutions to a given set of equations. It is like a collection of answers that all work for the equations.
