# Left and right (algebra)

Left and right in algebra refer to the sides of an equation. On the left side of the equation is the part that is being solved for, and on the right side of the equation is the part that has the answer. For example, in the equation 3x + 4 = 10, the left side of the equation is 3x + 4 and the right side of the equation is 10. To solve for x, you would subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, so the left side would become 3x and the right side would become 6. Then, you would divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2, which is the answer.
