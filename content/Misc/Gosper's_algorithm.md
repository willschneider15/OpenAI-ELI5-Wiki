# Gosper's algorithm

Gosper's algorithm is a way of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It works by breaking down the two numbers into smaller pieces. Then, it uses a series of steps to find the GCD.

First, it divides each number by two until both numbers are odd. Then, it subtracts the smaller number from the larger one, and repeats this process until the two numbers are equal. Finally, it multiplies the last two numbers together, and this is the GCD.

Gosper's algorithm is an easy way to find the GCD of two numbers. It is efficient, and it works well for large numbers.
