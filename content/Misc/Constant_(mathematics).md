# Constant (mathematics)

A constant is a number or value that remains unchanged in a given equation or formula. It is used to represent a value that does not change. In mathematics, constants are used to represent known values that are used in equations and formulas to arrive at a result. For example, the constant pi (Ï€) is used in many equations to calculate the circumference or area of a circle. Constants can also be used to represent values that are not known, such as the gravitational constant (G). Constants are also used to represent physical constants, such as the speed of light or the mass of an electron. Constants are an important part of mathematics and are used to make calculations easier and more accurate.
