# Equating coefficients

Equating coefficients is a mathematical technique used to solve equations. It involves setting two equations with the same variables equal to each other and then solving for the variables. By doing this, the coefficients (the numerical values of the variables) can be compared and equated. This is useful when solving equations that involve multiple variables, as it allows the equations to be simplified and solved more easily. For example, if two equations have the same variables but different coefficients, equating coefficients can be used to find the value of the variables. This technique can also be used to solve linear equations by comparing the coefficients of the two equations and equating them to each other.
