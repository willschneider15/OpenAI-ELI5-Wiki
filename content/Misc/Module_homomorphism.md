# Module homomorphism

Module homomorphism is a type of mathematical structure that links two modules together. A module is a type of algebraic structure that has two operations: addition and multiplication. A module homomorphism is a mapping between two modules that preserves the operations of both modules. This means that if two elements are added together in one module, the same two elements added together in the other module will have the same result. Similarly, if two elements are multiplied together in one module, the same two elements multiplied together in the other module will have the same result. Module homomorphisms are used to show relationships between different modules and can help to better understand the structure of a module.
