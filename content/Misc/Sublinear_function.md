# Sublinear function

A sublinear function is a mathematical function that grows at a rate slower than the rate of growth of the input. It is a type of function that is not linear, which means its rate of growth is not directly proportional to the input. For example, if the input increases by a factor of two, the output of a sublinear function increases by less than a factor of two. Sublinear functions are used in many areas of mathematics and computer science, such as algorithms, optimization, and machine learning. They are often used to describe the complexity of certain problems, as well as the efficiency of algorithms. Sublinear functions can also be used to analyze the scalability of systems, as well as the time complexity of algorithms.
