# Quaternionic matrix

Quaternionic matrices are a type of matrix that are used to describe rotations in three-dimensional space. They are made up of four numbers (called quaternions) which represent the three Euler angles and a scaling factor. Quaternionic matrices can be used to rotate an object in 3D space, or to transform a vector from one coordinate system to another. They are particularly useful for describing rotations in virtual reality applications, where precise 3D rotations are needed. Quaternionic matrices are also useful for describing rotations in robotics and animation.
