# Associative property

The associative property is a mathematical property that states that the order in which numbers are grouped in a calculation does not affect the outcome. For example, in the equation (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4), the numbers can be grouped in any order and the result will be the same. This is because the associative property states that the order in which the numbers are grouped does not matter. 

The associative property can be applied to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, in addition, the order in which two or more numbers are added does not change the result. In subtraction, the order in which two or more numbers are subtracted does not change the result. In multiplication, the order in which two or more numbers are multiplied does not change the result. In division, the order in which two or more numbers are divided does not change the result. 

In summary, the associative property states that the order in which numbers are grouped in a calculation does not affect the outcome. This property can be applied to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
