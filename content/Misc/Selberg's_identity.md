# Selberg's identity

Selberg's identity is a mathematical formula that relates the prime numbers to the zeta function. It was discovered by Atle Selberg in 1948. The formula states that the sum of the prime numbers up to a certain number is equal to the product of the zeta function at that number and the natural logarithm of that number. In other words, it states that the sum of the prime numbers is connected to the zeta function. This formula is important because it helps us understand the distribution of prime numbers and how they are related to other mathematical concepts.
