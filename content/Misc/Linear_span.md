# Linear span

Linear span is a concept from linear algebra that describes the size of a set of vectors. A set of vectors is said to have a linear span if it can be used to create any other vector in the same space. This means that the set of vectors contains all the information necessary to create any other vector in the same space. 

In other words, a set of vectors has a linear span if it is able to span the entire vector space. This is important because it allows us to represent any vector in the space using only the vectors in the set. This can be useful for solving linear equations and other mathematical problems.
