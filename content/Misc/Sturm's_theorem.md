# Sturm's theorem

Sturm's Theorem is a mathematical theorem that helps to find the number of real roots of a polynomial equation. It states that if you divide the polynomial equation by its leading coefficient, then the number of distinct real roots of the equation is equal to the number of changes in the sign of the remainder.

For example, if a polynomial equation is divided by its leading coefficient and the remainder has two changes in sign, then the equation has two distinct real roots. The theorem also states that if the remainder has the same sign at the start and end, then the equation has an even number of real roots.
