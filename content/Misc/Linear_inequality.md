# Linear inequality

Linear inequality is a mathematical statement that involves two expressions with an inequality sign. The inequality sign can either be greater than (>) or less than (<). It states that one expression is either greater than or less than the other expression.

For example, if we have the following linear inequality:

x > 5

This statement means that the expression x is greater than 5. In other words, any value of x that is greater than 5 will satisfy this inequality.

Linear inequalities can also be written in the form of a graph. The graph of a linear inequality is a line that divides the coordinate plane into two regions. The region that satisfies the inequality is shaded.

Linear inequalities are used in many fields, including economics, engineering, and physics. They are also used to solve problems related to optimization, such as finding the maximum or minimum value of a certain expression.
