# Triangle inequality

The Triangle Inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must always be greater than the third side. This means that the length of any side of a triangle must always be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. For example, if side A is 4 units long, side B is 6 units long, then side C must be less than 10 units long. If side C is 10 units long or more, then the three sides could not form a triangle. In other words, the Triangle Inequality helps us determine if three given lengths can form a triangle or not.
