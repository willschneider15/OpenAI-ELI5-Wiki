# Pythagorean trigonometric identity

Pythagorean trigonometric identity is a mathematical equation that states that the sum of the squares of the two sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This equation is written as: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This identity is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who first proved it.

The Pythagorean identity can be used to solve for the unknown side of a right triangle when the other two sides are known. This is especially useful when the lengths of two sides are known, but the length of the hypotenuse is unknown. To solve for the unknown side, the Pythagorean identity can be rearranged to solve for c, the hypotenuse.

The Pythagorean identity is also important in trigonometry. It is used to define the trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine, and tangent. These functions are used to calculate angles and lengths in triangles.

Overall, the Pythagorean identity is an important equation that is used to solve for unknown sides in right triangles and is also used in trigonometry.
