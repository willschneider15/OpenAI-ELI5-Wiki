# Cis (mathematics)

Cis is a mathematical concept that helps us understand how to rotate a figure around a point. It lets us take a figure, like a triangle, and rotate it around a point, like the center of a circle, without changing the size or shape of the figure.

Cis is a combination of two words: “ci” and “s”. “Ci” stands for “circle” and “s” stands for “shift”. So, when we rotate a figure around a point, we are “cis-shifting” it.

Cis is used in many areas of mathematics, like geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. It can help us understand how to move a figure in a certain way, like rotating a triangle around the center of a circle. It can also help us solve problems, like finding the area of a rotated figure or the angle of a rotated line.
