# Operad

An operad is a way to organize mathematical operations. It's like a set of instructions that tells us how to combine different operations together. 

For example, if you want to add two numbers, you could use an operad to tell you how to do it. First, you would write down the two numbers you want to add. Then, you would use the operad to tell you how to combine them. You could add them together, subtract one from the other, multiply them, or divide them. 

The operad also tells us how to combine more than two operations. For example, if you wanted to add three numbers, you could use the operad to tell you how to combine them. You could add them all together, subtract one from the other two, multiply them all together, or divide them all. 

Using an operad helps us to keep track of all the different operations we need to do and makes it easier to combine them. It's like a set of instructions that tells us how to combine different operations together.
