# Cramer's theorem (algebraic curves)

Cramer's theorem is a theorem in algebraic geometry which states that two algebraic curves of the same degree are equivalent if and only if they have the same number of points of intersection with a third curve of the same degree. This means that if two curves have the same number of points of intersection with a third curve, then the two curves are the same. This theorem is useful for determining if two curves are the same.
