# Polynomial mapping

Polynomial mapping is a type of mathematical function that uses polynomials to relate two sets of points. It is used to transform one set of points into another set of points. The mapping is done by taking the coordinates of each point and substituting them into a polynomial equation. The resulting equation will give the coordinates of the new points. Polynomial mapping can be used to change the shape of a figure, rotate it, or scale it up or down. It is also used in computer graphics to create smooth transitions between two different images.
