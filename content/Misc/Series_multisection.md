# Series multisection

A series multisection is a type of electrical transformer that is made up of several sections connected in series. This type of transformer is used in applications such as power distribution, voltage regulation, and impedance matching. Each section of the transformer is designed to have a different voltage rating, allowing the transformer to be used in a range of applications. The series multisection transformer is typically used in high-voltage applications, as it can provide a high amount of power with minimal losses. The transformer can also be used to reduce voltage levels in order to protect equipment from power surges. Additionally, the transformer can be used to match the impedance of different circuits, allowing for efficient power transfer between them.
