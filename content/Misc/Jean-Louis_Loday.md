# Jean-Louis Loday

Jean-Louis Loday was a French mathematician who developed the concept of cyclic homology, which is a way of studying the algebraic structure of certain objects. It is based on the idea that certain objects can be broken down into smaller pieces, and these pieces can then be put back together in different ways. This helps to understand the relationships between the pieces and how they interact with each other. Cyclic homology is a powerful tool for studying algebraic structures, and it is used in many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
