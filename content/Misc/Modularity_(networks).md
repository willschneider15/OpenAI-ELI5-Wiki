# Modularity (networks)

Modularity is a concept in network science that refers to the degree to which a network can be divided into distinct, well-connected subgroups. Each subgroup is known as a "module" and each module has a distinct pattern of connections within it and between other modules. Modularity can be used to identify communities of nodes within a network, which can help researchers better understand the structure and dynamics of the network. Modularity can also be used to identify important nodes in the network, such as hubs or bridges, which can be used to better understand how information flows through the network.
