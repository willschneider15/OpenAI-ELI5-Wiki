# Centrosymmetric matrix

A centrosymmetric matrix is a type of matrix that has a special property: when the elements of the matrix are reversed across the center of the matrix, the elements remain the same. This means that the elements on the left side of the center are the same as the elements on the right side of the center, and the elements on the top of the center are the same as the elements on the bottom of the center. For example, a 3x3 centrosymmetric matrix might look like this:

|  1  |  2  |  3  |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  2  |  4  |  2  |
|  3  |  2  |  1  |

The elements on the left side of the center (1, 2, 3) are the same as the elements on the right side of the center (3, 2, 1), and the elements on the top of the center (1, 2, 3) are the same as the elements on the bottom of the center (3, 2, 1). This property of centrosymmetric matrices makes them useful in many areas, such as
