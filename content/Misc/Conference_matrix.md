# Conference matrix

A conference matrix is a tool used to organize and compare the performance of teams in a sports league. It helps to determine which teams are the strongest and which teams are the weakest. The matrix is organized by columns and rows, with each team listed in a separate row and column. Each row and column contains information such as the team's wins, losses, and ties. The intersection of two teams' rows and columns gives the number of times those two teams have played each other. This information can be used to compare the performance of teams against each other, and to determine which teams are the strongest and which teams are the weakest. The conference matrix is a useful tool for coaches, players, and fans to get an idea of the overall performance of teams in a league.
