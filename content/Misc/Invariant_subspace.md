# Invariant subspace

An invariant subspace is a subspace of a vector space that is unchanged by a linear transformation. In other words, it is a subspace that remains the same when a linear transformation is applied to it. This means that any vector in the subspace will remain in the subspace after the transformation is applied. Invariant subspaces are useful for understanding how a linear transformation works and how it affects the vector space. They can also be used to simplify calculations and provide insight into the structure of the vector space.
