# Lapped transform

Lapped transforms are a type of data compression technique used to reduce the amount of data needed to represent a signal. They work by taking a signal, breaking it up into small segments, and then using a mathematical algorithm to represent each segment with fewer data points. The result is a compressed version of the original signal that still preserves the important features of the signal. This is useful for applications such as audio and video streaming, where large files need to be transferred quickly and efficiently.
