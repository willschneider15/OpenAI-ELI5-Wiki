# Dual basis

Dual basis is a concept used in linear algebra to represent a vector space. It is composed of two sets of vectors that are related to each other in a specific way. The two sets of vectors are called the basis vectors and the dual basis vectors. The basis vectors span the vector space, while the dual basis vectors are a set of linear combinations of the basis vectors that are orthogonal to each other. The dual basis vectors can be used to represent the same vector space, but in a different way. This can be useful for solving linear equations and for visualizing the vector space in a different way.
