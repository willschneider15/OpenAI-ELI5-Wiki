# Near sets

Near sets are a type of data structure that allows for efficient search and retrieval of data. They are used in various applications such as web search, recommendation systems, and machine learning. A near set is a collection of objects that share some similarity. This similarity can be based on various parameters such as distance, time, or other attributes. 

The near set is composed of a set of objects that are close to each other in some way. The near set is organized in a way that allows for efficient search and retrieval of data. Each object in the near set is associated with a score, which is used to measure the similarity between objects. Objects with higher scores are considered to be closer in similarity than those with lower scores. 

Near sets are useful for quickly finding data that is similar to a given query. They can also be used to group related objects together, allowing for faster retrieval and analysis. Near sets are also useful for clustering and classification tasks, as they can be used to group objects into distinct categories.
