# Strongly regular graph

A strongly regular graph is a type of graph that has a certain amount of regularity in its structure. It is composed of a set of vertices, with a certain number of edges connecting each vertex to other vertices. Each vertex has the same number of edges, and each edge is connected to the same number of vertices. Additionally, the graph has the property that any two vertices that are not adjacent to each other have the same number of common neighbors. This type of graph has many applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields.
