# Spherical basis

Spherical basis is a way of representing data points using angles and distances. It is commonly used in 3D graphics, computer vision, and robotics. 

In spherical basis, a point is represented by two angles, the azimuth angle and the elevation angle, and the distance from the origin. The azimuth angle is the angle between the point and the x-axis, and the elevation angle is the angle between the point and the z-axis. The distance is the distance from the origin to the point. 

Using spherical basis, it is easy to calculate distances between points, and to rotate points around the origin. This makes it useful for applications such as navigation, where the direction and distance of a point from the origin are important.
