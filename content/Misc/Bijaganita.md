# Bijaganita

Bijaganita is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of algebraic equations. It's a way to solve equations with two unknowns. It was developed by the Indian mathematician Bhaskara in the 12th century.

In Bijaganita, equations are written with two unknowns, usually represented by letters. The goal is to find the values of the unknowns that make the equation true. To do this, we use a variety of techniques, such as algebraic manipulation, substitution, and elimination.

Bijaganita can be used to solve a variety of problems, from finding the area of a triangle to calculating the interest on a loan. It's an important tool for any mathematician, and it's an important part of math education.
