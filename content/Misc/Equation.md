# Equation

Equations are mathematical statements that show how two things are related. They are written with an equal sign (=) between two expressions. The left side of the equation is equal to the right side. 

For example, the equation 2 + 3 = 5 shows that two plus three is equal to five. In this equation, the left side is 2 + 3 and the right side is 5. 

Equations can also be used to solve problems. For example, if you know that two plus three is equal to five, you can use this equation to figure out that five minus three is equal to two. 

Equations are used in many areas of mathematics, from basic arithmetic to complex problems. They are also used in science, engineering, and other fields.
