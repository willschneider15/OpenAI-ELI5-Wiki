# Invertible module

Invertible modules are mathematical objects that can be used to solve equations. They are similar to matrices, but instead of having a fixed number of rows and columns, they are made up of a set of equations with a variable number of terms. An invertible module is a set of equations that have a unique solution. This means that, when given a set of equations, the module can be used to find the exact solution. This makes it very useful in solving complex equations. Invertible modules can also be used to find the inverse of a matrix, which is useful for solving linear equations. In addition, they can be used to solve systems of equations, which can be used to find the roots of polynomials. In short, invertible modules are powerful tools for solving equations and finding solutions.
