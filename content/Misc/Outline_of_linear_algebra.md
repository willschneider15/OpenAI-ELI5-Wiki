# Outline of linear algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear transformations. It is used to solve problems involving vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations.

At its core, linear algebra is about understanding and manipulating linear equations. Linear equations are equations where the highest power of each variable is one. These equations can be used to describe a variety of real-world phenomena, such as the motion of a car or the population of a city.

Linear algebra also involves the study of linear transformations. These transformations take one set of values and transform them into another set of values. For example, a transformation might take a set of points in the plane and rotate them around the origin.

Linear algebra is an important tool for many fields, including engineering, economics, and computer science. It is used to solve problems involving vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. Understanding the fundamentals of linear algebra can help you solve a wide variety of problems.
