# K-frame

K-frame is a type of robotic exoskeleton that is worn on the body like a suit. It helps people with physical disabilities to move and walk more easily. The K-frame is made up of a series of metal bars and motors that are connected to the person's body. The motors help the person move their legs and arms, and the bars help support their body weight. The K-frame is controlled by a computer that helps the person move in a more natural way. With the help of the K-frame, people with physical disabilities can move around more easily and independently.
