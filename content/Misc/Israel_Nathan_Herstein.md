# Israel Nathan Herstein

Israel Nathan Herstein was an American mathematician who worked on abstract algebra. He is best known for his book, "Non-Commutative Rings", which was published in 1968. Herstein's work focused on algebraic structures, specifically rings and fields. He believed that all algebraic structures could be studied using the same basic principles. He also developed the concept of "Hersteinization," which is the process of taking an algebraic structure and transforming it into a simpler form. Herstein's ideas have been influential in the development of modern algebra. He is remembered for his contributions to the field of mathematics and for his ability to make complex concepts understandable to students.
