# Bra–ket notation

Bra–ket notation is a way of representing vectors and other mathematical objects in quantum mechanics. It uses a combination of brackets and bars to represent a vector. The bar is used to denote the conjugate transpose of the vector, which is the same as the vector but with the opposite sign. The brackets are used to denote the inner product of two vectors, which is the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the two vectors. Bra–ket notation is a useful tool for quantum mechanics, as it allows for concise and precise expressions of quantum states.
