# Row and column vectors

Row vectors are vectors that are written horizontally, with each element of the vector placed in its own row. For example, a row vector of size 3 would look like this: 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    a \\ 
    b \\ 
    c
\end{bmatrix}

Column vectors are vectors that are written vertically, with each element of the vector placed in its own column. For example, a column vector of size 3 would look like this: 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    a & 
    b & 
    c
\end{bmatrix}

Row and column vectors can be used to represent a variety of mathematical objects, such as points in a plane or a linear transformation. In addition, they can be used to represent the coordinates of a point in a space or the coefficients of a linear equation.
