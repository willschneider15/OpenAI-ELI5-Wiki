# Orthogonal basis

Orthogonal basis is a set of vectors that are mutually perpendicular, meaning they have a dot product of zero. Orthogonal basis can be used to represent a vector in a different coordinate system. This is done by expressing the vector as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The advantage of using orthogonal basis is that it simplifies calculations and makes them easier to understand. Orthogonal basis can also be used to find the projection of a vector onto another vector, which can be used to solve problems in physics, engineering, and other fields.
