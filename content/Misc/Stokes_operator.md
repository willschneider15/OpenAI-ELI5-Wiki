# Stokes operator

The Stokes operator is a mathematical tool used to describe the flow of fluids. It is a vector operator that takes a vector field (such as velocity) and produces a scalar field (such as pressure). The Stokes operator is used to solve problems such as calculating the pressure of a fluid or predicting the motion of particles in a fluid. It is named after George Stokes, an Irish mathematician and physicist who developed the operator in the 1800s. The operator is a combination of the divergence, curl, and Laplacian operators, which are all used to describe the flow of fluids. By combining these three operators, the Stokes operator can be used to accurately describe the behavior of a fluid.
