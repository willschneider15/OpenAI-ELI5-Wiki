# Early Algebra

Early algebra is a way of teaching math to children that focuses on the relationships between numbers and operations. It helps children understand the patterns and structures that are found in mathematics. Early algebra teaches children to think abstractly, use problem solving skills, and make connections between different concepts. It also encourages children to use logic and reasoning to solve problems. Early algebra helps children build a strong foundation for later math learning. It helps them develop an understanding of how math works and how to apply it to their everyday lives.
