# Identity (mathematics)

Identity in mathematics is a statement that is true for all values of a given variable. It is an equation that holds true no matter what the value of the variable is. For example, the equation x + 0 = x is an identity because it is true for all values of x.

Another example of an identity is the equation xÂ² = x * x. This equation is true for all values of x, no matter what the value of x is.

Identity equations are useful in mathematics because they allow us to determine if a given equation is true for all values of the variable, without having to test each individual value. This makes it easier to solve equations and prove theorems.
