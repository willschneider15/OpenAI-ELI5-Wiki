# Dual space

Dual space is a concept in linear algebra that describes the relationship between two sets of vectors. It is a way of looking at the same set of vectors from two different perspectives.

From one perspective, the vectors can be thought of as coordinates in a particular space. This is called the primal space. From the other perspective, the same vectors can be thought of as coefficients in a linear combination of basis vectors. This is called the dual space.

The dual space is related to the primal space in that the basis vectors in the dual space are the coordinates of the primal space and vice versa. This means that the dual space can be used to describe the same set of vectors in a different way. This can be useful when looking at linear equations and systems of equations, as it can help to simplify the equations.
