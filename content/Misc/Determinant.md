# Determinant

Determinants are mathematical objects that are used to describe the size and shape of a matrix. A determinant is a number that is calculated from the elements of a matrix. The determinant of a matrix is a single number that can be used to determine many properties of the matrix, such as its size, shape, and whether or not it is invertible. 

To calculate a determinant, you need to use a specific formula that depends on the size of the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the formula is: det(A) = a*d â€“ b*c, where a,b,c, and d are the elements of the matrix. For a 3x3 matrix, the formula is a bit more complicated and involves multiplying and adding the elements of the matrix. 

The determinant of a matrix is an important concept in linear algebra. It can be used to calculate the inverse of a matrix, solve systems of equations, and find the area of a triangle. It is also used in calculus to find the area under a curve.
